**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `0b9986c` | expansion | Issue #50 - Smoke test failure investigation | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Expansion Worker**
- Issue: [#50 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/50)
- Conversation: [`0b9986c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/0b9986c096a64db19b13b124ce20a87e)

**Previous Workers (finished):**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `f1f534e` | merge | PR #49 (E2E onboarding tests) | finished ✓ |

**Current State:**
- No open PRs (PR #49 merged successfully)
- **NEW Issue #50:** CI smoke test failure after PR #49 deploy
  - Auto-rollback initiated to commit dee78f1
  - Needs investigation before continuing with other work
- Ready issues: #44 (priority:high), #45, #46, #47 (priority:medium)
- All other issues expanded - expansion slot: occupied (investigating #50)

**Decision:**
- PR slot: Available but **HOLDING** - smoke test failure needs resolution first
- Expansion slot: Spawned worker to investigate Issue #50 (CI failure)
- Once #50 is diagnosed/fixed, will resume implementation of Issue #44

**Notes:**
- Smoke test failed on commit 5b538a5 (PR #49 merge)
- Production auto-rolled back to dee78f1
- Workflow: https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/actions/runs/25528955142

### 2026-05-08 00:40 UTC - Issue #50 Investigation Complete

🔍 **Smoke Test Failure Investigated**

**Issue:** [#50 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/50)
**Failed Commit:** `5b538a5` (PR #49 merge)
**Rollback Target:** `dee78f1` (automatic rollback succeeded)

**Root Cause Identified:**

1. **Build Failure**: TypeScript compilation failed during deployment with 28 `TS6053: File not found` errors for `@types` packages
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Deploy script lacks `set -e`, so build failure didn't stop deployment
3. **Stale Deploy**: Server restarted with incomplete/stale `client/dist` files
4. **Symptom**: `/dashboard` returned "Not Found" instead of React SPA

**Evidence:**
```
error TS6053: File '/var/www/vr.chorecraft.net/app/node_modules/@types/react-dom/index.d.ts' not found.
npm error Lifecycle script `build` failed with error:
npm error code 1
...
Deployed successfully at Fri May  8 00:07:37 UTC 2026  <-- despite build failure!
```

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Add `set -e` to deploy script in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Clean node_modules on production server before next deploy

**Issue Updated:** 
- Root cause analysis added to issue body
- `ready` label added
- Status: Ready for implementation

**Production Status:** ✅ Healthy (rollback succeeded, verified via health endpoint)

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `1826cdc` | implementation | Issue #50 - Fix CI deployment failure | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#50 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/50) (priority:high)
- Conversation: [`1826cdc`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/1826cdc9fba64d9ba354eea53e8500f3)

**Previous Workers (finished):**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `0b9986c` | expansion | Issue #50 - Investigation | finished ✓ |
| `f1f534e` | merge | PR #49 (E2E onboarding tests) | finished ✓ |

**Current State:**
- No open PRs (implementation in progress)
- **CRITICAL:** Issue #50 is a CI/deployment fix that must be resolved before other work
- Ready issues: #50 (priority:high, implementing), #44 (priority:high), #45, #46, #47 (priority:medium)
- All issues expanded - expansion slot idle

**Decision:**
- PR slot: Spawned implementation worker for Issue #50 (CI failure fix)
- Expansion slot: Idle (all issues expanded)

**Priority Assessment:**
- Added `priority:high` label to Issue #50 (CI failure is a deployment blocker)
- Once #50 is merged, will resume with Issue #44 (E2E QR code tests)

**Housekeeping:**
- Truncated WORKLOG.md: archived 3 old entries from 2026-05-07
