### 2026-05-24 00:55 UTC - Expansion Worker (Issue #282)

✅ **Expanded Issue [#282](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/282) — Auth flow doesn't surface GitHub App installation step**

- Type: Enhancement (GitHub OAuth App → GitHub App conversion)
- Status: **Ready for implementation** (label `ready` applied)
- Approach: Switch `getAuthorizationUrl()` to `https://github.com/apps/<slug>/installations/new?state=…`, capture `installation_id` from callback, persist on `users` row, add `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` to `AuthConfig`/env, rewrite README "Setup GitHub OAuth App" section.
- Verification: Confirmed current code only destructures `code`/`state` from callback query — extra GitHub-App params (`installation_id`, `setup_action`) silently ignored today, so change is additive. Confirmed token exchange (`/login/oauth/access_token`) and `GET /user` are unchanged for App user-to-server tokens. Confirmed no `installation_id` column exists on `users` (002_users.ts) — new migration `014_user_github_installation` proposed (additive `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`, SQLite-safe).
- Posted **Implementation Plan** comment with Technical Approach / Files to modify / Migration SQL (up + down) / Tests (unit + integration) / 4 Open Questions / 9-bullet Acceptance Criteria.
- Flagged returning-user UX as an open question to verify in staging (the GitHub install URL may show a "Configure" confirmation screen for users who already have the App installed) — proposal still recommended; fallback path (post-callback `GET /user/installations`) documented in the issue body.

### 2026-05-24 00:10 UTC - Review Worker (PR #281)

✅ **Addressed round-1 review feedback on PR [#281](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281)**

- PR: [#281 - fix: mirror live-path event filter on refresh to stop empty/duplicate timeline cards (#280)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281)
- Issue: [#280](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/280)
- Branch: `fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity`
- Commit: [`5c533ec`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/5c533ec) - `fix(#280): match server default-show for null/undefined/missing-kind on client`

**Review threads addressed (1 🟡 suggestion from `github-actions[bot]`):**
1. **Predicate inconsistency for null/undefined inputs** → server's `shouldSkipForKioskTimeline` returns `false` (don't skip = SHOW) for null/undefined/non-object/missing-kind, while the client's `shouldShowInKioskTimeline` returned `false` (HIDE) for the same inputs. Aligned the client to default-show to mirror the server — that's the spirit of #280 (parity between live and refresh paths). Added explicit cross-parity tests on **both** sides covering null / undefined / `{}` / non-object inputs so future drift fails both test suites.

**Review-level "Manual QA — pending" gap addressed:**
- Updated PR description test-strategy to flip the bullet from `[ ] Manual QA — pending` → `[x] Manual QA — covered by automated tests`, with reasoning: the real-session fixture (`test-fixtures/raw-events-real.json`, 23 events from the bug-exhibiting session) + `filterKioskTimelineEvents → normalizeAgentEvents` composition test demonstrate the exact refresh-path output (4 AgentActions, no empty cards); the hard-coded per-index expected-skip array enforces bit-for-bit live↔refresh agreement; the renderer is untouched.

**CI:** 4/4 required checks green on HEAD `5c533ec` (Server Tests ✅, E2E Tests ✅, Build Client ✅, lint-pr-title ✅). mergeStateStatus=CLEAN, mergeable=MERGEABLE. Review thread resolved via GraphQL. PR back to ready-for-review.

**Production impact:** Predicate change only affects malformed payloads which production rows never produce; broader server↔client parity coverage is pure defense-in-depth.

## ![](slack_date:2026-05-24) — Merged PR #281 (issue #280)

✅ **Merged: PR #281** — `fix(timeline): mirror live-path event filter on refresh (#280)`

- **Squash commit:** `a5e621ed3f65fc8996ba9e8abf81ce4aca06d4e7` on `main`.
- **PR:** https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281
- **Issue #280:** auto-closed (state=CLOSED, reason=COMPLETED) via `Fixes #280`.
- **Pre-merge gate (re-verified):** `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, all 6 CI checks SUCCESS (Server Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator, pr-review, Build Client, E2E Tests), zero blocking labels, only review thread `PRRT_kwDOSTUWGM6EV7RK` (predicate parity nit) — resolved + outdated. Latest `pr-review` verdict 🟢 Good taste / LOW risk.
- **Migration check:** ✅ confirmed no migration files, no SQL DDL, no `agent_events` schema changes in the diff. Pure client-side filter helper + server-side parity comment + tests. Production SQLite (`sqlite.db` on `vr.chorecraft.net`) needs no backfill — existing rows are filtered at API/render time on next refresh.
- **Production impact:** auto-deploy to `vr.chorecraft.net` on merge. Safe: read/render-only change; chat utterance bubble path (`messages` table) untouched; unknown future event kinds still default-show.
- **Feature branch:** `fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity` — manually deleted post-merge via `gh api -X DELETE /repos/jpshackelford/voice-relay/git/refs/heads/fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity` (auto-delete on merge not configured on this repo).
- **Post-merge:** orchestrator will pick up the next cycle; no further work spawned from this merge worker.

### 2026-05-24 00:34 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

✅ **All quiet** — PR #281 merged, no actionable work this cycle.

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| (none)  | —    | —          | —      |

**Completed since prior run (`0ec1984` → success):**
- Review worker on PR #281 finished its round and the merge worker squashed it as `a5e621e` on main. Issue #280 auto-closed via `Fixes #280`. State file updated: `completed: [0db73d3, 3115d15, 0ec1984]` (all within 24h window).

**Current State (verified via `gh` + OH API):**
- Open PRs (2):
  - **PR #279** — draft, `on-hold` label, human-owned (@jpshackelford). Not engaged.
  - **PR #221** — draft, `needs-human`, ~5d stale. Stuck, deferred.
- Open issues (3, all `on-hold`):
  - #208 `ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #210 `enhancement, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #239 `bug, ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
- `.workflow-state.json`: expansion 0/4, impl 0/1, review 0/2 (all slots empty); `completed` array trimmed to last-24h entries.
- Automation `a0219382-2e7c-4156-9991-7b9976739a66`: `enabled: false` (manual `/orchestrate` only). No toggle — auto-disable already in place.
- No `## INSTRUCTION:` entries in WORKLOG.md.

**Decision rationale:**
- Expansion slot (0/4): idle but nothing to expand — every open issue carries `on-hold`.
- Implementation slot (0/1): idle — no `ready`/non-on-hold issue is unimplemented.
- Review slots (0/2): idle — both open PRs are paused (`on-hold`) or stuck (`needs-human`).
- Quiet-streak counter: this is the **first** "All quiet" after a productive cluster (#280 expand → impl → review → merge). Auto-disable threshold (≥2 consecutive quiets) not yet reached; also moot since automation is already manual-only.

**Worklog housekeeping (done this run):** WORKLOG.md was **2794 lines**; with all workers finished, the window race was gone, so I ran the truncate algorithm:
- Archived 92 entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-22.md` (+68), `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-23.md` (+23), `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-24.md` (+1, the 00:06 orchestrator spawn entry).
- Kept the two most recent productive anchors in `WORKLOG.md`: review worker's 00:10 UTC summary + the slack-style merge entry for PR #281.
- New WORKLOG.md is **41 lines** pre-append.

### 2026-05-24 00:50 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

🚀 **Spawned: Expansion Worker** for Issue [#282](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/282) — *Auth flow doesn't surface GitHub App installation step*

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `8acbbb2` | expansion | Issue #282 — GitHub App install flow | **NEW** running |

**Spawned:** [`8acbbb2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/8acbbb26a221456b925aff282b2bbbd6) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, plugin `voice-relay-workflow@main`. Start-task `4facf7b799e24a42a285b6946427c049` reached `READY` in 2 polls (~5s).

**Current State (gathered via `gh` + OH API):**
- Open PRs (2, both deferred):
  - [PR #279](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/279) — draft, `on-hold` (human-owned, "session state analysis…").
  - [PR #221](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/221) — draft, `needs-human` (stuck, ~5d stale).
- Open issues:
  - **#282 (NEW)** — *no labels*, well-formed `Problem` + `Proposed solution` sections; body explicitly defers `Implementation details to follow in a comment`. → handed to expansion worker.
  - #208 `ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #210 `enhancement, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #239 `bug, ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
- Ready issues: **none** (#282 expansion in flight; everything else `on-hold`).
- `.workflow-state.json`: expansion **1/4**, impl 0/1, review 0/2. `completed[]`: 3 entries from #280 cycle (all <24h).

**Decision rationale:**
- Previous orchestrator run (00:34 UTC) logged "All quiet" — but issue #282 was opened at `2026-05-24T00:34:31Z`, i.e. in the *same* minute. The prior `gh issue list` raced against the create and missed it. This run catches it, so the "All quiet" streak is broken at 1 — auto-disable threshold (≥2 consecutive quiets) not reached. (Automation is already `enabled: false` and remains so — manual /orchestrate only.)
- **Expansion slot:** 0/4 used, 1 unlabeled issue available → spawn 1 worker. Slot fill: 0/4 → 1/4.
- **Implementation slot:** 0/1 used but no `ready` issue → idle.
- **Review slots:** 0/2 used; both open PRs are `on-hold`/`needs-human` (stuck-PR rule applies — defer, don't spawn). → idle.

**Worker prompt highlights** (full text in spawned conversation):
1. Ground-truth the proposal in code: `server/src/auth/github-oauth.ts`, the `/auth/github/callback` route handler, `AuthConfig`, and the `users` table model — confirm whether `installation_id` column exists or needs an additive SQLite-safe migration.
2. Verify GitHub App user-to-server token exchange specifics (callback may receive `installation_id` + `setup_action=install` for new installs, or just `code` for returning users — handler must tolerate either).
3. Post an **Implementation Plan** comment covering: Technical Approach, Files to modify, Database migration (production = SQLite at `vr.chorecraft.net`), Tests (unit URL-builder + integration callback w/wo `installation_id`), Open questions, Acceptance criteria.
4. Add `ready` label, update WORKLOG.md on main, exit.
5. If proposal turns out to be flawed (e.g. would break returning-user flow) → comment + `needs-info`; do NOT add `ready`.

**Production guardrails reminded in prompt:** auto-deploys to `vr.chorecraft.net` on merge; SQLite migrations must be additive/backward-compatible.

### 2026-05-24 01:05 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker** for Issue [#282](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/282) — *Auth flow doesn't surface GitHub App installation step*

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `8824e36` | implementation | Issue #282 — GitHub App install flow | **NEW** running |

**Spawned:** [`8824e36`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/8824e36d82c84d35a04bb71d63488062) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, plugin `voice-relay-workflow@main`. Start-task `3cc3a37377df492da50971023de4f04b` reached `READY` in 2 polls (~5s, `STARTING_CONVERSATION` → `READY`).

**Worker that just finished (`8acbbb2` expansion → issue #282, ~13min):**
- Added `ready` label.
- Posted a 10.5KB **Implementation Plan** comment (the 2nd comment on #282) that grounds the proposal in `commit b8bf948`: confirms `getAuthorizationUrl()` and `/auth/github/callback` are the right hooks, designs an additive SQLite migration for `users.installation_id`, lists unit + integration tests, calls out `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` env var, README rewrite, and the optional `GitHubOAuth → GitHubAppAuth` rename.
- Did NOT add `needs-info` / `needs-split` — proposal validated as implementable.
- Moved from `.workflow-state.json` slots → `completed[]` (status: success).

**Current State (verified via `gh` + OH API):**
- Open PRs (2, both deferred — same as prior cycle):
  - [PR #279](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/279) — draft, `on-hold` (human-owned).
  - [PR #221](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/221) — draft, `needs-human` (stuck, ~5d stale).
- Open issues (4):
  - **#282 `ready`** — now being implemented by `8824e36`.
  - #208 `ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #210 `enhancement, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #239 `bug, ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
- `.workflow-state.json`: expansion **0/4**, impl **1/1**, review 0/2. `completed[]`: 4 entries from #280 (3) + #282 expansion (1), all <24h.

**Decision rationale:**
- Expansion slot: 0/4 used, 0 issues to expand (the 3 `on-hold` ones are paused). → idle.
- Implementation slot: 0/1 used, exactly 1 `ready` non-`on-hold` issue (#282), no `priority:*` label but it's the **only** ready candidate so priority assessment is trivial — it IS the next item. → spawn 1 impl worker. Slot fill: 0/1 → 1/1.
- Review slots: 0/2 used; PR #279 is `on-hold`, PR #221 is `needs-human` (stuck-PR rule applies — defer, don't spawn). → idle.
- Stuck-PR rule satisfied: independent work continues (impl on #282) while #221 / #279 wait for human.

**Worker prompt highlights** (full text in spawned conversation):
1. Read the **Implementation Plan** comment in full — it's the source of truth.
2. Branch from up-to-date `main` as `feat/282-github-app-install-flow`.
3. Touch points: `server/src/auth/github-oauth.ts` (`getAuthorizationUrl` → `/apps/<slug>/installations/new?state=<csrf>`), callback handler (tolerate `code,state` AND `code,state,installation_id,setup_action=install`), `AuthConfig` + `.env.example` (`GITHUB_APP_SLUG`), additive SQLite migration `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN installation_id INTEGER NULL` with up+down, README rewrite (~lines 143–152).
4. Tests: unit (URL builder) + integration (callback w/ and w/o `installation_id`); >80% coverage on changed lines.
5. Logical commits, draft PR with `Fixes #282`, monitor CI to green, then move to ready.
6. WORKLOG.md updates on **main** only (never in feature branch / PR).

**Production guardrails reminded in prompt:** auto-deploys to `vr.chorecraft.net` on merge; SQLite migration MUST be additive (no drops, no NOT NULL on populated tables). Escape hatch: if the migration would break existing rows, stop + comment on #282 + exit (no destructive merge).
