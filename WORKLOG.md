# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

**Current backlog:**
- [#9 - F1: Scope messages to sessions](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/9)
- [#10 - F2: Replace Dashboard with Workspace Home](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/10)
- [#11 - F3: Session View (remove setup, auto-detect mode, QR idle state)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/11)
- [#12 - F4: Join session via QR code](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/12)

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

| `66856a7` | merge | PR #39 - Auto-dismiss QR code | finished ✓ |
| `bf855fb` | implementation | Issue #28 | finished ✓ |

✅ **Completed:** PR #39 Merged Successfully
- [PR #39](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/39) - feat: auto-dismiss QR code when mobile device joins
- [Issue #28](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/28) auto-closed on merge

**Current State:**
- No open PRs
- No ready issues (none with `ready` label)
- Blocked issue: #22 (needs-split - "Scan QR code and join")
- All expansion work complete

✅ **All quiet** - No work to pick up

The only open issue (#22) has `needs-split` label - needs human intervention to break it into smaller issues before the workflow can continue.

**Next Steps:**
- Human should split issue #22 into implementable sub-issues
- Each sub-issue should get expanded (technical detail added) and labeled `ready`
- Then workflow will resume implementation

✅ **All quiet** - No work to pick up

**Current State:**
- No open PRs

The only open issue (#22) has `needs-split` label - needs human intervention to break it into smaller issues before the workflow can continue.

**Note:** This is the 2nd consecutive quiet period. If the next orchestrator run also finds nothing to do, automation will auto-disable.

**Next Steps:**
- Human should split issue #22 into implementable sub-issues
- Each sub-issue should get expanded and labeled `ready`
- Then workflow will resume implementation

🔒 **Auto-disabled due to inactivity**

Two consecutive quiet periods detected - no new work to pick up.
Automation has been disabled to prevent unnecessary runs.

**Current State:**
- No open PRs
- No ready issues (none with `ready` label)
- Only open issue: [#22](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/22) - `needs-split` label

**To re-enable:**
- OpenHands UI: https://app.all-hands.dev/automations → Find "Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator" → Toggle enable
- Or via API:
  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/a0219382-2e7c-4156-9991-7b9976739a66" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"enabled": true}'
  ```

**Next Steps:**
1. Human should split issue #22 ("Scan QR code and join") into implementable sub-issues
2. Each sub-issue should get expanded (technical detail added) and labeled `ready`
3. Re-enable automation to resume the workflow

### 2026-05-07 12:18 UTC - Investigation: Issue #22 "needs-split" Status

🔍 **Investigation performed by AI agent (OpenHands) at user request**

**Finding:** Issue #22 was partially implemented through related issues/PRs but never formally split.

#### Phase A: Fix Owner's New Device Registration - ✅ COMPLETE

The bug preventing owner's new device from registering was fixed through:

| Issue/PR | Title | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| [#23](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/23) | Sending messages to a session does not work | ✅ Closed |
| [PR #26](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/26) | fix(server): register device before adding to session | ✅ Merged |
| [#20](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/20) | Auto add first device | ✅ Closed |
| [PR #29](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/29) | feat: auto-register first device when creating default workspace | ✅ Merged |

**Root Cause (Fixed):** Device registration failed due to FK constraint violation - devices were added to `session_devices` before existing in `devices` table.

**Related Improvements Also Merged:**
- [#12](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/12) / [PR #17](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/17) - QR code session join with auto-join workspace
- [#18](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/18) - Security: signed/time-limited QR tokens
- [#28](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/28) / [PR #39](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/39) - Auto-dismiss QR code when mobile joins

#### Phase B: Pending Join Request Flow - ⏳ NOT IMPLEMENTED

The approval workflow for non-owner users has NOT been implemented:
- No `workspace_join_requests` table
- No `/approve`, `/deny` endpoints
- No WebSocket join-request messages
- No "Waiting for approval" UI

#### Actions Taken

1. ✅ Added comment to [Issue #22](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/22#issuecomment-4397065058) documenting:
   - Complete list of related issues/PRs that addressed Phase A
   - Confirmation that Phase B is still pending
   - Recommendation for next steps

#### Recommendation

- **Phase A**: Complete - no further work needed
- **Phase B**: Should be extracted to a new dedicated issue if still desired
- Issue #22 could be closed with Phase B extracted, or kept open for Phase B work only

---
### 2026-05-07 12:45 UTC - Issue Filed for Phase B

🎫 **Created dedicated issue for remaining Phase B work**

After careful analysis of the codebase, filed [Issue #40: feat: Implement pending join request approval flow for workspaces](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/40)

**What Was Analyzed:**
- Reviewed all migrations (001-008) - no `workspace_join_requests` table exists
- Checked `server/src/workspaces/router.ts` - no approval endpoints exist
- Searched for WebSocket join-request messages - none implemented
- Verified client has no approval UI components
- Confirmed `allowAutoJoin` setting exists but only controls auto-join (not approval flow)

**What Was Implemented (existing):**
- `workspace_members` table and membership management
- `allow_auto_join` setting in `workspace_settings`
- Auto-join endpoint with rate limiting when `allowAutoJoin=true`
- Direct join via join code (bypasses approval entirely)

**What's Missing (filed in #40):**
- `workspace_join_requests` table (new migration 009)
- 4 new API endpoints: `/requests`, `/request-join`, `/approve`, `/deny`
- 3 WebSocket message types: `join-request`, `join-response`, `join-resolved`
- 2 UI components: `JoinRequestNotification`, `WaitingForApproval`
- Request expiration logic (5 minute timeout)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (Medium-High complexity)

**Issue #22 Status:**
- Added comment linking to new Issue #40
- Recommended closing #22 since Phase A is complete and Phase B has dedicated issue

---
### 2026-05-07 13:52 UTC - Orchestration Re-enabled

🚀 **Workflow orchestration resumed**

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Closed Issue #22 - Split work complete, Phase A implemented, Phase B extracted
2. ✅ Added `ready` label to Issue #40 - Ready for implementation
3. ✅ Re-enabled automation via API

**Current State:**
- Open issues: [#40](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/40) - Pending join request approval flow (`ready`, `enhancement`)
- Automation: **ENABLED** (cron: every 30 min)
- Next scheduled run: Within 30 minutes

**Issue #40 Summary:**
- Implements DESIGN.md Section 12 (QR Code Join Flow - Multi-User)
- Database migration for `workspace_join_requests` table
- 4 new API endpoints for approval workflow
- 3 new WebSocket message types
- 2 new UI components
- Estimated: 2-3 days

The orchestrator will pick up Issue #40 on next scheduled run and spawn an implementation worker.
