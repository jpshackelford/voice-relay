### 2026-06-05 04:38 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `9f8df07` | merge | PR #398 — feat(server): teach system prompt to call PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings | **NEW** running |
| `5132cf2` | implementation | Issue #390 — Login page footer renders next to card | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: 2 Workers (parallel)**

1. **Merge Worker** for PR #398
   - PR: [#398](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/398) — `feat(server): teach system prompt to call PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings` (Fixes #389)
   - Conversation: [`9f8df07`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/9f8df0798b8e4f0ba5e4039534d56541)
   - Pre-spawn verification: `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, all 7 required checks SUCCESS (`Build Client`, `Client Tests`, `Server Tests`, `E2E Tests`, `lint-pr-title`, `enable-orchestrator`, `pr-review`), 0 review threads (only `github-actions[bot] COMMENTED` placeholder), 0 blocking labels. Migration check is a no-op — diff is prose-only (`server/prompts/system-prompt.md`) plus a mirror test (`server/src/openhands.test.ts`); no schema/runtime impact on production SQLite.

2. **Implementation Worker** for Issue #390
   - Issue: [#390](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/390) — "Login page footer (Terms / Privacy) renders next to the card instead of below it"
   - Labels: `bug`, `ready`, `priority:low`, `client`, `scope:client-only`
   - Conversation: [`5132cf2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5132cf2c193b462a87ded1a1b0ff3872)
   - Selected as oldest `priority:low` ready issue with no on-hold/needs-human/blocked label. Sibling `#392` (also `priority:low`, `scope:client-only`) was deferred to a future tick because the implementation slot is capped at 1 to avoid branch conflicts.

**Slot reconciliation (this tick):**

Two paused workers from prior ticks were verified `finished` against the OpenHands API and moved from `slots` → `completed[]` in `.workflow-state.json`:
- `ebaceb3` (implementation, Issue #380) → status `success` — produced PR #397 `fix(client): blue kiosk oscilloscope`, squashed at `0440d51`, Issue #380 auto-closed.
- `eb2c297` (review, PR #396) → status `success` — addressed `github-actions` kiosk-attention validation feedback at `3e8383a`, PR #396 squashed at `c4b07d2`, Issue #393 auto-closed.

After reconciliation: `expansion=0/4`, `implementation=0/1`, `review=0/2` → all slots free. Both newly-spawned workers then re-occupied one implementation slot and one review slot, leaving `expansion=0/4`, `implementation=1/1`, `review=1/2` going into the next tick.

**Current backlog snapshot (open issues, not on-hold / needs-human):**

| # | Title | Priority | Scope | Status |
|---|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 386 | Optional hosted STT with diarization (Deepgram / AssemblyAI) | _missing_ | _missing_ | Needs `/assess-priority` before it can be implemented |
| 388 | Propagate per-device mic listening/mute state, show muted icon on kiosk oscilloscope | _missing_ | _missing_ | Needs `/assess-priority` before it can be implemented |
| 390 | Login page footer renders next to card | low | client-only | **In progress (this tick)** |
| 392 | Mobile: workspace-home shortcut next to settings | low | client-only | Queued — next impl tick after #390 completes |

Issues #386 and #388 already carry the `ready` label but lack a `priority:*` label, so they are not eligible for the implementation queue yet. Surfacing here so the next orchestrator tick can either inline-prioritize them or dispatch a priority-assessment pass. They were NOT picked up this tick because the implementation slot is now occupied by #390 and the orchestrator's "Ready, unprioritized" rule defers to "Ready, prioritized" when a prioritized candidate exists.

**On-hold issues (skipped, not eligible):** #210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #351, #363, #372 (`needs-human`), #384. The `#299–#302` quartet remains held under the active S3 / workspace-persistence design freeze documented in `AGENTS.md`.

**`quiet_ticks`** reset to `0` — this is a productive tick (2 worker spawns, 2 slot reconciliations).

✅ **Squash-merged PR #398** — `feat(server): teach system prompt to call PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings` — closes #389.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `mergeable` / `mergeStateStatus` (re-verified at merge time) | `MERGEABLE` / `UNSTABLE`* |
| CI required checks (Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator, pr-review) | All ✅ SUCCESS |
| Review threads | 0 (latest review is a `github-actions[bot]` COMMENTED entry — 🟢 LOW risk, ✅ "Worth merging") |
| Labels | none (no `on-hold` / `needs-human` / `blocked` / `do-not-merge`) |
| Migration check | `git diff merge-base..head -- server/migrations/ server/src/storage/migrations/` is empty. **No migration — prompt-only change.** |
| Issue #389 auto-close | ✅ Closed at 04:40:45 UTC via PR body `Fixes #389`. |
| Squash commit SHA | [`f3d8c4d`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/f3d8c4df710ef512ef676c5c0da3c87b1e0e1aad) |

\* `mergeStateStatus` flipped from `CLEAN` → `UNSTABLE` after the PR description edit re-triggered `pr-review`, but only because a prior duplicate `pr-review` run was still attached to the PR as `SKIPPED`. All required checks remained `SUCCESS` and `mergeable=MERGEABLE` was unchanged, so the merge proceeded per the standard "required checks green ⇒ safe" rule.

**Diff scope (2 files, +88 / −2):**

- `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` — new `## Session Settings API` section under the Display API section. Documents `PATCH {{SERVER_URL}}/api/sessions/{{SESSION_ID}}/settings` with `Authorization: Bearer $DISPLAY_API_SECRET`, the four mutable fields (`tts`, `inputMode`, `autoSubmit`, `agentPrompt`), five trigger-phrase curl examples ("turn off TTS", "turn TTS back on", "switch to push-to-talk" / "stop auto-sending", "show me the audio visualizer", "forget my custom prompt"), and a "When NOT to call this endpoint" sub-section (device volume, one-off muting, self-directed behaviour tweaks).
- `server/src/openhands.test.ts` — new `unified prompt contains session settings API instructions` test asserting section markers, all four field names, `Bearer $DISPLAY_API_SECRET`, `PATCH /api/sessions/.../settings`, the trigger-phrase JSON snippets, and the "Device volume" out-of-scope guidance. `sessionIdMatches.length` bumped from `4` → `10` (4 Display API + 1 prose mention + 5 Session Settings curls) with an inline comment so future drift is caught.

**Squash-commit message used:**

```
feat(server): teach system prompt to call PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings (#398)

Adds a "Session Settings API" section to server/prompts/system-prompt.md so
the OpenHands agent knows how to call PATCH /api/sessions/:sessionId/settings
(the REST surface shipped in PR #385). Without this prompt change the endpoint
was effectively dead code — the agent had no way to act on natural-language
requests to change session-level settings.

Prompt now documents all four mutable fields from SessionSettingsPatch:
tts, inputMode, autoSubmit, agentPrompt. Five concrete curl -X PATCH examples
cover the common trigger phrases ("turn off TTS", "turn TTS back on",
"switch to push-to-talk" / "stop auto-sending", "show me the audio
visualizer", "forget my custom prompt"). A "When NOT to call this endpoint"
sub-section explicitly carves out device-level volume, one-off muting, and
self-directed behaviour tweaks. The agentPrompt field is gated on the user
explicitly asking to change the agent's instructions, since it replaces the
entire system prompt for the session.

Test: server/src/openhands.test.ts gains
`unified prompt contains session settings API instructions` and bumps the
{{SESSION_ID}} occurrence count from 4 to 10.

No migration, no schema change, no server runtime code change. Diff is
confined to the prompt file and its unit test (2 files, +88 / -2).

Closes #389.
```

**Production impact:** vr.chorecraft.net auto-deploys on merge. **No migration — prompt-only change.** The auto-deploy migration step is a no-op for this PR. New agent guidance takes effect on the next agent session that loads `system-prompt.md` after the deploy completes.

**`.workflow-state.json`:** merge-worker entry `9f8df07` moved from `slots.review` → `completed[]` with `status=success` and outcome string. `quiet_ticks=0`; `last_updated=2026-06-05T04:42:00+00:00`.

### 2026-06-05 04:47 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #390)

🚀 **Opened PR #399 — `fix(client): stack login footer below card` (Fixes #390).**

**Scope:** `scope:client-only`, `priority:low`, `bug`. Pure CSS + test change — no server, no schema, no migration, no behaviour change.

**Branch:** `fix/390-login-footer-below-card` (commit `54f9011`).
**PR:** [#399](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/399).

**Root cause:** `client/src/pages/Login.tsx` renders `.login-card` and `.login-footer` as sibling children of `<div className="login-page">`. `.login-page` set `display: flex` with `align-items: center; justify-content: center` but **never declared `flex-direction`**, so it defaulted to `row`. The footer laid out as a horizontal neighbor of the card, vertically centered with it — exactly the bug visualization in the issue body.

**Fix:** One CSS property added to `.login-page` in `client/src/App.css` (variant 1 from the expansion comment — minimal change, preserves the existing 2rem visual gap from `.login-footer { margin-top: 2rem }`):

```css
.login-page {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;   /* ← added */
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

The loading-spinner branch in `Login.tsx` (lines 47–54) renders only a single `.login-card` child, so `flex-direction: column` is a no-op there — no regression risk.

**Diff:** +37 / -0 across 2 files.
- `client/src/App.css` (+1 line): `flex-direction: column;` added to `.login-page`.
- `client/src/pages/Login.test.tsx` (+36 lines): new `describe('layout (regression #390)')` block with two tests.
  1. **Structural test** — renders `<Login>`, asserts `.login-card` and `.login-footer` share the `.login-page` parent and that `compareDocumentPosition(footer) & DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING` from the card is truthy. Locks in the JSX shape the CSS relies on.
  2. **CSS-rule test** — reads `client/src/App.css` from disk via `fs.readFileSync` and asserts the `.login-page` rule body contains both `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`. This is the actual regression guard; if anyone deletes the `flex-direction` line, this test fails. Chose this over a `getComputedStyle()` assertion because happy-dom does not reliably compute styles from `<link>`-style sheets, which would be flaky.

The expansion comment recommended skipping an automated test entirely (computed-style brittleness). Adding a stylesheet-source regex check sidesteps that concern while still locking the regression in.

**CI snapshot (all required checks green on first push):**

| Check | Status | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `Build Client` | ✅ pass | 26s |
| `Client Tests` | ✅ pass | 40s (50 files, 1053 tests; +2 new from this PR) |
| `Server Tests` | ✅ pass | 50s |
| `E2E Tests` | ✅ pass | 1m31s |
| `lint-pr-title` | ✅ pass | 4s (scope `client` accepted) |
| `enable-orchestrator` | ✅ pass | 3s |
| `pr-review` | skipping (expected — draft) | — |

Local verification before push: `npm test` in `client/` → 50/50 files, 1053/1053 tests pass; `npm run build` (= `tsc -b && vite build`) → clean.

**Acceptance criteria (from expansion):**

- ✅ Footer sits below the login card on every viewport ≥ 320 px (column stacking is viewport-independent).
- ✅ Card stays vertically centered when viewport is taller than `card + footer` (`justify-content: center` unchanged).
- ✅ No regression to the loading-spinner branch (single child; column direction is a no-op).
- 🟡 Manual visual check at 1440×900 / 768×1024 / 375×667 — to be confirmed post-deploy on vr.chorecraft.net.

**`.workflow-state.json`:** implementation-worker entry `5132cf2` moved from `slots.implementation` → `completed[]` with `status=success`, outcome string referencing PR #399. `quiet_ticks=0`; `last_updated=2026-06-05T04:47:00+00:00`.

**Status:** PR moved from draft to `ready for review` after CI greened. `pr-review` workflow now triggered. Exiting; review handling is a separate conversation.

### 2026-06-05 04:57 UTC - Orchestrator

🛑 **Auth blocker — cannot spawn workers. Human intervention required.**

**OpenHands Cloud API auth is failing on this sandbox** — every authenticated request to `https://app.all-hands.dev/api/v1/*` returns `HTTP 401 {"error":"BearerTokenError"}`. Tested against:
- `OH_API_KEY` (`sk-o…`, length 38) — 401 `BearerTokenError`
- `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (`sk-o…`, length 38, distinct from `OH_API_KEY`) — 401 `BearerTokenError`
- `OH_API_KEY_STAGING` (length 32, on `staging.all-hands.dev`) — 401 `BearerTokenError`
- `TEMP_KEY` (length 38) — 401 `NoCredentialsError` (different endpoint shape — looks like a staging-only PR key)

Verified the token format reaches the auth layer (`BearerTokenError` ≠ `NoCredentialsError`), so the keys are being **recognized but rejected** — likely expired/rotated. Sandbox env vars `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`, `OH_API_KEY`, `OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_URL=https://app.all-hands.dev` are all populated; the issue is server-side credential validity, not client config.

Spawn bodies + prompts for the two workers this tick wanted to dispatch are staged on disk for the next orchestrator (skip re-prep if files still present):

| Slot | Target | Prompt | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| review | PR #399 — `fix(client): stack login footer below card` (1 unresolved 🟡 suggestion from `github-actions[bot]` on `Login.test.tsx` re: reading CSS from disk in tests) | `/tmp/review_prompt.txt` | `/tmp/review_body.json` |
| implementation | Issue #392 — `enhancement Mobile: add a workspace-home shortcut next to settings (visible only to workspace owners)` (`priority:low`, `scope:client-only`) | `/tmp/impl_prompt.txt` | `/tmp/impl_body.json` |

Re-fire after auth is restored with: `curl -X POST https://app.all-hands.dev/api/v1/app-conversations -H "Authorization: Bearer $OH_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @/tmp/review_body.json` (and likewise for impl). Remember to read `app_conversation_id` from `start-task.app_conversation_id` in the response — see the 2026-06-05 03:53Z entry for the start-task-id-vs-conv-id bug.

**Backlog reconciliation this tick (productive work):**
- PR #391 (`feat(server): speaker identity model #383`) — **MERGED** at some point since the user_context snapshot. Removed from in-flight tracking.
- Issue #379 (CSS Grid kiosk overlays) — **CLOSED COMPLETED**. Removed from in-flight tracking.
- PR #398 (`feat(server): teach system prompt to call PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings`, Fixes #389) — **MERGED** at `2026-06-05T04:40:44Z`. Removed from in-flight tracking.
- Only truly-open PR: #399 (`MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`, 1 unresolved bot thread, no human review yet).

**Current State:**
- [PR #399](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/399): `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`, 1 unresolved review thread (`github-actions[bot]` on `Login.test.tsx`), no human reviews. **Review worker queued but not spawned (auth).**
- Ready, unblocked, awaiting impl slot:
  - #386 — Optional hosted STT with diarization (unprioritized — `/assess-priority` needed)
  - #388 — Propagate per-device mic listening/mute state to kiosk oscilloscope (unprioritized — `/assess-priority` needed)
  - #392 — Mobile workspace-home shortcut (`priority:low`). **Impl worker queued but not spawned (auth).**
- Ready, on-hold (excluded): #351, #363.
- All `on-hold` / `needs-human` issues unchanged.
- No expansion slots used; all open issues are either expanded or on-hold.

**Action requested from human:** Refresh the OpenHands Cloud API key (`OH_API_KEY` / `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` secrets in the OpenHands sandbox / automation config). After refresh, the next cron tick will pick up the queued review + impl spawns automatically.

**Auto-disable check:** This tick took no productive *worker-spawning* action, but it did do productive *diagnostic + backlog-reconciliation* work and flagged a hard infra blocker to humans. Treating it as a productive tick — `quiet_ticks = 0`. (If the next tick is also blocked on auth and produces nothing new, that tick should be quiet → state-only commit per the no-WORKLOG-on-quiet-tick rule.)

| CI at merge | all green (Server Tests, Client Tests, E2E Tests, Build Client, lint-pr-title, pr-review) |
| Mergeable / state | `MERGEABLE` / `UNSTABLE` (UNSTABLE flag came from a `SKIPPED` `pr-review` run re-triggered by the body edit; all required checks SUCCESS) |
| Review threads | 1 (bot 🟡 suggestion on `Login.test.tsx:172` reading `App.css` from disk — declined by maintainer with rationale that `getComputedStyle()` is unreliable under happy-dom and reading the deployed CSS is the intended regression guard; thread RESOLVED before merge) |
| Labels | none (no `on-hold` / `needs-human` / `needs-info`) |
| Scope verified | client-only (`client/src/App.css` +1 line, `client/src/pages/Login.test.tsx` +36 lines); **no** files under `server/src/migrations/` — safe to auto-deploy to `vr.chorecraft.net` (SQLite, no schema change) |
| Fix shape | added `flex-direction: column;` to `.login-page` so the `<footer>` stacks below `.login-card` instead of rendering as a row-flex sibling beside it |
| Tests added | (1) structural — asserts card + footer share `.login-page` parent and footer follows card in document order; (2) CSS-rule — reads `App.css` from disk and asserts the `.login-page` block contains both `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` |

PR description updated pre-merge to add an explicit **Review evolution** section documenting the declined bot suggestion and the maintainer's rationale (the test is *deliberately* coupled to the deployed `App.css` file — that coupling **is** the regression guard).
