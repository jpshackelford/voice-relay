# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

**Current backlog:**
- [#9 - F1: Scope messages to sessions](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/9)
- [#10 - F2: Replace Dashboard with Workspace Home](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/10)
- [#11 - F3: Session View (remove setup, auto-detect mode, QR idle state)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/11)
- [#12 - F4: Join session via QR code](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/12)

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

### 2026-05-08 14:31 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| (none) | - | - | - |

🔒 **Auto-disabled due to extended waiting period**

**Housekeeping:**
- ✅ Closed #81 as duplicate of #74 (same root cause)

**Current State:**
- No open PRs
- Open issues: #74 (critical, infrastructure)
- Ready issues: None
- 5+ consecutive "Waiting" entries for infrastructure issue

**Reason for Disable:**
The only open issue (#74) requires **manual SSH intervention** to fix:
- Node.js version upgrade (20.18.3 → 20.19+)
- Corrupted node_modules cleanup

This is NOT a code bug - CI tests pass successfully. Automation cannot help until server is manually fixed.

**To re-enable after fixing the server:**
1. SSH to vr.chorecraft.net and run the fix commands from #74
2. Verify the app is healthy: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health`
3. Close issue #74
4. Re-enable automation:
   - OpenHands UI: https://app.all-hands.dev/automations → "Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator" → Enable
   - Or via API:
     ```bash
     curl -X PATCH "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/a0219382-2e7c-4156-9991-7b9976739a66" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"enabled": true}'
     ```

### 2026-05-10 00:43 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| (this) | implementation | Issue #82 - AI toggle visibility | in-progress |

🚀 **Created: PR #83**
- PR: [#83 - fix(tests): open drawer before clicking AI toggle button](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/83)
- Issue: [#82 - Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/82)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The `.ai-toggle` button is inside the kiosk drawer
- Per F3 requirement, the drawer starts **collapsed** by default
- Tests tried to click the button without opening the drawer first
- PR #68's CSS fix works, but only when the drawer is open

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `ensureDrawerOpen()` helper to open the collapsed drawer
- Updated `waitForAIAvailabilityCheck()` to call `ensureDrawerOpen()` first
- Updated AI Unavailable test to also open drawer before checking

**CI Status:**
- Build Client: ✅ Pass
- Server Tests: ✅ Pass
- E2E Tests: ✅ Pass  
- PR Title Lint: ✅ Pass

**PR Status:** Ready for review

**Housekeeping:**
- ✅ Added root cause analysis comment to Issue #82
- ✅ Added `ready` and `priority:high` labels to Issue #82
- ✅ Archived 8 worklog entries from 2026-05-08

**Current State:**
- PR #83: CI green ✅, ready for review
- Open issues: #82 (linked to PR #83)
- Automation was re-enabled (manually by this orchestrator run)
