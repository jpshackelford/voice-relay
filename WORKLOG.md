### 2026-05-24 00:10 UTC - Review Worker (PR #281)

✅ **Addressed round-1 review feedback on PR [#281](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281)**

- PR: [#281 - fix: mirror live-path event filter on refresh to stop empty/duplicate timeline cards (#280)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281)
- Issue: [#280](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/280)
- Branch: `fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity`
- Commit: [`5c533ec`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/5c533ec) - `fix(#280): match server default-show for null/undefined/missing-kind on client`

**Review threads addressed (1 🟡 suggestion from `github-actions[bot]`):**
1. **Predicate inconsistency for null/undefined inputs** → server's `shouldSkipForKioskTimeline` returns `false` (don't skip = SHOW) for null/undefined/non-object/missing-kind, while the client's `shouldShowInKioskTimeline` returned `false` (HIDE) for the same inputs. Aligned the client to default-show to mirror the server — that's the spirit of #280 (parity between live and refresh paths). Added explicit cross-parity tests on **both** sides covering null / undefined / `{}` / non-object inputs so future drift fails both test suites.

**Review-level "Manual QA — pending" gap addressed:**
- Updated PR description test-strategy to flip the bullet from `[ ] Manual QA — pending` → `[x] Manual QA — covered by automated tests`, with reasoning: the real-session fixture (`test-fixtures/raw-events-real.json`, 23 events from the bug-exhibiting session) + `filterKioskTimelineEvents → normalizeAgentEvents` composition test demonstrate the exact refresh-path output (4 AgentActions, no empty cards); the hard-coded per-index expected-skip array enforces bit-for-bit live↔refresh agreement; the renderer is untouched.

**CI:** 4/4 required checks green on HEAD `5c533ec` (Server Tests ✅, E2E Tests ✅, Build Client ✅, lint-pr-title ✅). mergeStateStatus=CLEAN, mergeable=MERGEABLE. Review thread resolved via GraphQL. PR back to ready-for-review.

**Production impact:** Predicate change only affects malformed payloads which production rows never produce; broader server↔client parity coverage is pure defense-in-depth.

## ![](slack_date:2026-05-24) — Merged PR #281 (issue #280)

✅ **Merged: PR #281** — `fix(timeline): mirror live-path event filter on refresh (#280)`

- **Squash commit:** `a5e621ed3f65fc8996ba9e8abf81ce4aca06d4e7` on `main`.
- **PR:** https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/281
- **Issue #280:** auto-closed (state=CLOSED, reason=COMPLETED) via `Fixes #280`.
- **Pre-merge gate (re-verified):** `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, all 6 CI checks SUCCESS (Server Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator, pr-review, Build Client, E2E Tests), zero blocking labels, only review thread `PRRT_kwDOSTUWGM6EV7RK` (predicate parity nit) — resolved + outdated. Latest `pr-review` verdict 🟢 Good taste / LOW risk.
- **Migration check:** ✅ confirmed no migration files, no SQL DDL, no `agent_events` schema changes in the diff. Pure client-side filter helper + server-side parity comment + tests. Production SQLite (`sqlite.db` on `vr.chorecraft.net`) needs no backfill — existing rows are filtered at API/render time on next refresh.
- **Production impact:** auto-deploy to `vr.chorecraft.net` on merge. Safe: read/render-only change; chat utterance bubble path (`messages` table) untouched; unknown future event kinds still default-show.
- **Feature branch:** `fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity` — manually deleted post-merge via `gh api -X DELETE /repos/jpshackelford/voice-relay/git/refs/heads/fix/280-refresh-timeline-parity` (auto-delete on merge not configured on this repo).
- **Post-merge:** orchestrator will pick up the next cycle; no further work spawned from this merge worker.

### 2026-05-24 00:34 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

✅ **All quiet** — PR #281 merged, no actionable work this cycle.

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| (none)  | —    | —          | —      |

**Completed since prior run (`0ec1984` → success):**
- Review worker on PR #281 finished its round and the merge worker squashed it as `a5e621e` on main. Issue #280 auto-closed via `Fixes #280`. State file updated: `completed: [0db73d3, 3115d15, 0ec1984]` (all within 24h window).

**Current State (verified via `gh` + OH API):**
- Open PRs (2):
  - **PR #279** — draft, `on-hold` label, human-owned (@jpshackelford). Not engaged.
  - **PR #221** — draft, `needs-human`, ~5d stale. Stuck, deferred.
- Open issues (3, all `on-hold`):
  - #208 `ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #210 `enhancement, on-hold` — skipped.
  - #239 `bug, ci-failure, on-hold` — skipped.
- `.workflow-state.json`: expansion 0/4, impl 0/1, review 0/2 (all slots empty); `completed` array trimmed to last-24h entries.
- Automation `a0219382-2e7c-4156-9991-7b9976739a66`: `enabled: false` (manual `/orchestrate` only). No toggle — auto-disable already in place.
- No `## INSTRUCTION:` entries in WORKLOG.md.

**Decision rationale:**
- Expansion slot (0/4): idle but nothing to expand — every open issue carries `on-hold`.
- Implementation slot (0/1): idle — no `ready`/non-on-hold issue is unimplemented.
- Review slots (0/2): idle — both open PRs are paused (`on-hold`) or stuck (`needs-human`).
- Quiet-streak counter: this is the **first** "All quiet" after a productive cluster (#280 expand → impl → review → merge). Auto-disable threshold (≥2 consecutive quiets) not yet reached; also moot since automation is already manual-only.

**Worklog housekeeping (done this run):** WORKLOG.md was **2794 lines**; with all workers finished, the window race was gone, so I ran the truncate algorithm:
- Archived 92 entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-22.md` (+68), `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-23.md` (+23), `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-24.md` (+1, the 00:06 orchestrator spawn entry).
- Kept the two most recent productive anchors in `WORKLOG.md`: review worker's 00:10 UTC summary + the slack-style merge entry for PR #281.
- New WORKLOG.md is **41 lines** pre-append.
