### 2026-06-05 13:51 UTC - Orchestrator

🔒 **Auto-disabled due to inactivity** (2nd consecutive quiet tick)

No actionable work remained after PR #402 merged at 13:21:35Z:

- **Open PRs:** 0
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0
- **Ready+prioritized issues not on-hold/needs-human:** 0
- **All 10 open issues are blocked:**
  - `on-hold` (9): #210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #351, #363, #384
  - `needs-human` (1): #372
- **Active workers:** 0 (merge worker `8919f27` for PR #402 finished cleanly; sandbox PAUSED at 13:21:51Z)

Quiet-tick counter went `1 → 2`, so per the auto-disable rule the v2 orchestrator automation (`5f180989-ed9c-42b4-ac9f-5f30f0623316`) has been disabled to prevent unnecessary cron runs while the backlog is fully blocked. The S3 workspace-persistence design freeze (#298–#302, per `AGENTS.md`) is still in effect, which is why those issues remain `on-hold`.

**To re-enable** (after a human unblocks one or more of the on-hold/needs-human issues, or files new work):

- OpenHands UI: https://app.all-hands.dev/automations → "Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator v2" → toggle on
- Or via API:
  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/5f180989-ed9c-42b4-ac9f-5f30f0623316" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"enabled": true}'
  ```

### 2026-06-05 22:18 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `5e8b184` | implementation | Issue #403 — Refresh/rebind workspace API key | **NEW** |

🔓 **Re-enabled automation `5f180989-ed9c-42b4-ac9f-5f30f0623316`** ("Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator v2") — `PATCH /api/automation/v1/{id} {"enabled": true}` returned 200. Auto-disabled at 13:51Z; new work (#403, #404) has since landed, so resuming.

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker**

- Issue: [#403 — Refresh & rebind use the env-keyed singleton OpenHandsClient instead of the per-workspace API key](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/403) (`bug`, `ready`, `priority:high`, `critical`, `scope:server-only`)
- Conversation: [`5e8b184`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5e8b184eabaa45428fb04226194b3ff4)
- Start-task id: `bb71d91466da4849ac449e07e0e81161` → `app_conversation_id = 5e8b184eabaa45428fb04226194b3ff4` (`status = READY` on first poll; `execution_status = running`, `sandbox_status = RUNNING`)
- Plugin ref: `voice-relay-workflow @ main`

**Current State:**
- **Open PRs:** 0 (PR #402 squash-merged at 13:21:35Z — `feat(server): hosted STT (Deepgram) broker + workspace settings`, closed Issue #386).
- **Ready+prioritized issues (unblocked):**
  - **#403** — `priority:high`, `critical` — **NOW IN IMPL SLOT** ✅
  - **#404** — `priority:medium`, depends on #403 per comment "Cleanup follow-up that depends on this fix: #404" → deliberately deferred until #403 lands so the cleanup PR isn't fighting the bugfix PR.
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 (both #403 and #404 already have `ready` label and full technical-approach bodies).
- **Ready issues on-hold (excluded):** #351, #363.
- **Issues without `ready` label that are skipped:** all are `on-hold` or `needs-human` (#210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #372, #384).
- **Active slot summary:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 0/2.

**Decision rationale:**
- 0 open PRs → no review/merge work this tick.
- Impl slot was empty (1 available) → spawn for highest-priority unblocked ready issue.
- #403 (`priority:high` + `critical`) outranks #404 (`priority:medium`). #404 is also a dependent cleanup of #403, so even ignoring priority it must wait.
- No expansion work — all unexpanded issues are `on-hold`/`needs-human`.
- After this spawn: expansion 0/4 idle (nothing eligible), impl 1/1 full, review 0/2 idle (no open PRs).

**Why the orchestrator was off when this tick fired:** the v2 automation auto-disabled at 13:51Z when the backlog was fully blocked (all 10 open issues at that moment were `on-hold` / `needs-human`). Between 13:51Z and 22:18Z, @jpshackelford filed #403 and #404, which made the backlog actionable again — but auto-disable correctly prevented the cron from spinning idle in the interim. Manual `/orchestrate` invocation is the documented unblock path.

**Quiet-tick counter:** reset `2 → 0` (productive tick).

### 2026-06-05 22:35 UTC - Implementation worker (#403)

✅ PR opened and CI green for the workspace-key recovery-path fix.

- Issue: [#403 — Refresh & rebind use the env-keyed singleton OpenHandsClient instead of the per-workspace API key](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/403)
- PR: [#406](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406) — `fix(server): refresh & rebind honor per-workspace OpenHands API key (#403)`
- Branch: `fix/403-workspace-key-in-refresh-rebind`
- Status: marked **ready for review** (review-bot triggered).

**What landed:**
- `AISession` gains `workspaceId` + `apiKey?`; populated at both construction sites (`getOrCreateForSession`, `attachExistingForSession`).
- New `clientForSession(session)` helper used by `doRefreshSessionCredentials` and `doRebindSession`.
- `pollSandboxRunning` and `buildRebindReplaySuffix` now take an explicit client so the resume poll and memory-replay GET use the same bearer as the rest of the path.
- Env fallback (`this.client`) preserved end-to-end — strict superset of today's behaviour. Removing it is tracked in #404 (deliberately not rolled in).

**Tests:** new `AISessionManager workspace-key resolution (#403)` describe block — 8 cases covering refresh, rebind (POST + events-page GET), PAUSED→RUNNING resume, key rotation, env-fallback preservation, and clean degrade when no client is configured. Full server suite passes (1547 tests / 76 files). The two regression guards called out in the issue body (`auto-connect.test.ts:317–329` and `agent-rehydrate.test.ts:238–258`) still pass.

**CI status (PR #406):** Server Tests ✅ • Client Tests ✅ • Build Client ✅ • E2E Tests ✅ • lint-pr-title ✅

### 2026-06-05 22:35 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ca35fb8` | implementation | Issue #405 — Typed reason for missing WS handshake materials | **NEW** |

**Worker Completed Last Tick:** `5e8b184` (implementation, Issue #403) → **finished**
- Created [PR #406](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406) — `fix(server): refresh & rebind honor per-workspace OpenHands API key (#403)`.
- All required CI checks green; `pr-review` IN_PROGRESS; `mergeable=MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus=UNSTABLE` (gated on pr-review verdict). No unresolved review threads yet — nothing to address this tick.

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker**

- Issue: [#405 — Replace opaque 'missing WS handshake materials' error with a typed, self-describing reason](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/405) (`enhancement`, `ready`, `priority:low`, `scope:server-only`)
- Conversation: [`ca35fb8`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ca35fb869e5d4f45bdcc567cfe01ed71)
- Start-task id: `a2f89df0f4d34f109700c5d3214beaad` → `app_conversation_id = ca35fb869e5d4f45bdcc567cfe01ed71` (`status = READY` on first poll; `execution_status = running`, `sandbox_status = RUNNING`)
- Plugin ref: `voice-relay-workflow @ main`
- Heads-up given to worker: PR #406 also touches `server/src/openhands.ts`; rebase if it lands first; scope is the typed-reason error model in `getOrCreateForSession` only.

**Current State:**
- **Open PRs:** 1 — [PR #406](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406) (Issue #403). Status: `o pending ready` — required CI green, `pr-review` IN_PROGRESS, no unresolved threads.
- **Ready+prioritized issues (unblocked):**
  - **#403** → covered by PR #406 (closes on merge).
  - **#404** — `priority:medium`, depends on #403/PR #406 — **deferred** until #406 merges (avoids fighting the bugfix PR).
  - **#405** — `priority:low` — **NOW IN IMPL SLOT** ✅ (independent of #406's diff modulo same file).
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0.
- **Ready issues on-hold (excluded):** #351, #363.
- **Issues without `ready` label that are skipped:** all are `on-hold` or `needs-human` (#210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #372, #384).
- **Active slot summary:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 0/2.

**Decision rationale:**
- Last tick's impl worker (5e8b184) successfully created PR #406 and exited — moved to `completed`.
- PR #406 has no unresolved review threads yet (pr-review still running). No review worker spawn needed; merge worker can't run while `mergeStateStatus=UNSTABLE`. Next tick will reassess once pr-review reports.
- Impl slot freed → spawn for highest-priority unblocked ready issue.
- Priority order of eligible unblocked: #404 (medium, blocked by #403/#406) → **skip**; #405 (low, independent) → **spawn**.
- Risk noted: #406 and #405 both edit `server/src/openhands.ts`. Surface areas are disjoint (#406 = refresh/rebind, #405 = `getOrCreateForSession` typed errors). Worker instructed to rebase if #406 merges first.
- No expansion work — all unexpanded issues are `on-hold`/`needs-human`.

**Quiet-tick counter:** reset `0 → 0` (productive tick: 1 worker spawned, 1 worker reaped to completed).

### 2026-06-05 22:50 UTC - Orchestrator (manual /orchestrate)

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ca35fb8` | implementation | Issue #405 — Typed reason for missing WS handshake materials | running |
| `e531d1f` | review | PR #406 — workspace-key fix (#403) | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Review Worker for PR #406**

- PR: [#406 — fix(server): refresh & rebind honor per-workspace OpenHands API key (#403)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406)
- Conversation: [`e531d1f`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e531d1f3cb7f4f319c84bf12309f8a3e)
- Start-task id: `ba773d70` → `app_conversation_id = e531d1f3cb7f4f319c84bf12309f8a3e` (`status = READY` on 2nd poll; `execution_status = running`, `sandbox_status = RUNNING`)
- Plugin ref: `voice-relay-workflow @ main`
- Scope: comment-only cleanup. 11 unresolved 🟡 *Suggestion* threads from the `pr-review` bot — all asking to shrink JSDoc/inline comments in `server/src/openhands.ts` that were added with the workspace-key fix. None are 🛑 blocking.

**PR #406 status at dispatch:**
- All required CI ✅ green: Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, pr-review (SUCCESS).
- `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`.
- 11 unresolved review threads (all from `github-actions` pr-review bot, all `isOutdated=false`).
- `reviewDecision=""` (no required human reviewers).

**Worker instructions emphasized:**
- Pragmatic accept/decline — accept the bot's compressed comments whenever the load-bearing info (the `#403` linkage / *why*) survives; decline only when an invariant would be dropped, and keep a one-line trimmed version in that case.
- Single squash-able commit `style(server): tighten comments per pr-review on #403 fix`. Comments-only diff — no behaviour change, no test changes.
- After resolving all 11 threads and re-greening CI, move PR back to ready and exit. **Merge handoff is a separate orchestrator tick.**
- WORKLOG.md only on `main`; `.workflow-state.json` is hands-off (orchestrator owns it). Branch Hygiene CI guard will reject either file in the PR branch.

**Current State:**
- **Open PRs:** 1 — [PR #406](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406) (Issue #403). Now: `oR green ready 💬11` → after this review round will become `oRF green ready 💬0` and eligible for the merge worker.
- **Ready+prioritized issues (unblocked):**
  - **#403** → covered by PR #406 (review round in flight).
  - **#404** — `priority:medium`, depends on PR #406 — **still deferred**.
  - **#405** — `priority:low` — implementation worker `ca35fb8` running (spawned at 22:35Z).
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 actionable. All unexpanded issues are `on-hold` (#210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #384) or `needs-human` (#372).
- **Ready issues on-hold (excluded):** #351, #363.
- **Active slot summary:** expansion 0/4 (no eligible work), implementation 1/1 full, review 1/2 (1 slot free, but no other PRs need attention).

**Decision rationale:**
- Last tick's reaping caught up to current state — `ca35fb8` (impl on #405) is still `running` per `/api/v1/app-conversations` query; left in place.
- PR #406 transitioned from `oR green ready` with `pr-review IN_PROGRESS` (last tick) to `pr-review SUCCESS` + 11 unresolved threads (this tick). Threads need addressing before the merge worker fires.
- Review slot available (0/2 → 1/2) → spawned exactly 1 review worker for PR #406. No other PRs exist, so the 2nd review slot stays idle.
- No expansion work — same on-hold backlog as last tick.
- No new implementation work — #405 is in flight and #404 is the only other eligible candidate but it's blocked on PR #406 landing.
- No merge worker yet: spawning one with 11 unresolved threads would either (a) merge over unaddressed feedback or (b) immediately bail and waste a slot. Better to let the review worker normalize the PR first.

**Quiet-tick counter:** reset `0 → 0` (productive tick: 1 review worker spawned).

### 2026-06-05 22:58 UTC - Review worker (PR #406 review round)

✅ Addressed all 11 🟡 *Suggestion* threads from `github-actions` pr-review bot on [PR #406](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/406) (#403 fix).

**Commit:** `819fd88` — `style(server): tighten comments per pr-review on #403 fix` (server/src/openhands.ts, +17 / -69, comments-only)

**Disposition:** all 11 suggestions accepted as-suggested or with a 1-line variant that preserved the load-bearing invariant. Notably:
- `clientForSession` docstring kept the `#404` env-fallback-removal reference per the orchestrator's "preserve invariant" guidance.
- `AISession.workspaceId` / `AISession.apiKey` JSDoc collapsed to single-line `/** … (#403). */` comments; the rotation NB is now implicit in "snapshot" + carried by `clientForSession` docstring.
- All 8 inline `// Issue #403:` block comments collapsed to either `// #403: honor workspace key` trailing comments or short `// Capture/Cache workspace context for refresh/rebind (#403)` headers; ones that simply restated the code were removed outright.

**CI:** all 5 required checks green on `819fd88` — Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title. `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `isDraft=false`.

**Threads:** 11/11 replied with `Fixed in 819fd88…` and resolved via `resolveReviewThread`. The pr-review workflow did not re-fire on this push (comment-only diff likely skipped its trigger paths) — 0 new threads.

PR #406 is ready for the merge worker on the next orchestrator tick.

### 2026-06-05 23:00 UTC - Implementation worker (#405)

✅ Opened [PR #407](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/407) — `feat(server): typed reason for missing-WS-handshake failure` (#405).

**Branch:** `feat/405-typed-handshake-reason` off `main` @ `c64de6f` (does not collide with PR #406's refresh/rebind paths).

**Scope:** server-only error-reporting refactor. No DB migrations, no env-var changes, no client changes, no new deps.

**Changes:**
- `server/src/openhands.ts`: new `MissingWsHandshakeReason` union (`auth-rejected` / `sandbox-stopped` / `sandbox-missing` / `paused-no-sandbox-id` / `unknown`); `UpstreamConversationEndedError` carries an optional readonly `reason`; pure classifier `explainMissingHandshake(convInfo, lastError?)`; renderer `formatMissingHandshakeMessage(id, reason)`; both throw sites (create-path in `getOrCreateForSession`, attach-path in `attachExistingForSession`) now emit the typed reason + self-describing message. `pollSandboxRunning` grew an optional `onTransientError` callback so the attach-path can capture the last swallowed 401 without leaking through the resolver contract.
- `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts`: `BindResult.error.cause: Error` so `openSession` and `restartSession` re-throw the original typed error instead of wrapping in `new Error(msg)`. Prior wrapping silently dropped the `.reason` on `UpstreamConversationEndedError` before it could reach the broadcast layer — caught and fixed during implementation; covered by 3 new driver tests.
- `server/src/auto-connect.ts` + `server/src/agent-rehydrate.ts`: when the caught error is an `UpstreamConversationEndedError` with a typed `reason`, propagate `err.message` into the `degraded` `session-state.error` field (and the matching legacy `session-ai-status.error` in `auto-connect.ts`). Otherwise keep the existing sanitized generic message.

**Tests:** +31 tests total — 23 in `openhands.test.ts`, 3 in `agent-driver/openhands.test.ts`, 3 in `auto-connect.test.ts`, 2 in `agent-rehydrate.test.ts`. **All 1570 server tests pass.** Coverage stays at 93.9% statements / 88.6% branches (≥ 80% threshold).

**CI on `d317d57`:** all required checks green — Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator. PR promoted from draft to ready for review; `pr-review` workflow will fire on the next tick.

**Acceptance criteria:** all six AC bullets satisfied (see PR description for the per-bullet mapping). Out-of-scope items (kiosk UI changes, auto-rotation policy, class-hierarchy refactor of `UpstreamConversationEndedError`) deliberately untouched.

**Coordination with PR #406:** different code paths (handshake throw sites + broadcast field vs. refresh/rebind). Will rebase onto `main` once #406 lands if there are textual conflicts in `server/src/openhands.ts` (none expected — different regions of the file).
