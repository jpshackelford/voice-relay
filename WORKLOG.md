### 2026-05-29 03:21 UTC - Orchestrator (manual `/orchestrate`)

🔒 **Auto-disabled due to inactivity** (2 consecutive quiet ticks).

**State at this tick:**

| Signal | Value |
|---|---|
| Open PRs | 0 (PR #359 merged at 02:51Z, #357 auto-closed) |
| Active workers | 0 / 0 / 0 (expansion / impl / review) |
| Open issues | 8, **all `on-hold`** — see breakdown below |
| `quiet_ticks` (pre-tick) | 1 |
| `quiet_ticks` (post-tick) | 2 → auto-disable triggered |

**Open issues — every one carries `on-hold`, so neither the expansion nor implementation dispatcher has anything to pick up:**

| # | Title (truncated) | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| 358 | re-do fresh-create fallback for ended upstream conversations | `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `on-hold`, `scope:server-only`, `server` |
| 351 | startup rehydration failures are silent until the user types | `bug`, `ready`, `priority:low`, `on-hold`, `scope:server-only` |
| 302 | Pause sandbox on extended Voice Relay workspace idle | `enhancement`, `priority:low`, `on-hold` |
| 301 | Granular startup status UX | `enhancement`, `priority:low`, `on-hold`, `client` |
| 300 | Snapshot /workspace to S3 on agent idle | `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `on-hold` |
| 299 | Restore /workspace from S3 on sandbox provisioning | `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `on-hold` |
| 239 | Flaky AI integration tests due to OpenHands API reliability | `bug`, `ci-failure`, `on-hold` |
| 210 | Categorize deployment failures to improve automated response | `enhancement`, `on-hold` |

**Why disable now:**
- The prior tick (03:04Z, no WORKLOG entry per the "When No Action Needed" rule) was already quiet: PR #359 had merged at 02:51Z and every open issue was already `on-hold`. That bumped `quiet_ticks` 0 → 1.
- This tick finds the same state: no PRs, no actionable issues, no in-flight workers. `quiet_ticks` 1 → 2 → auto-disable per the skill's [Auto-Disable on Consecutive Quiet Periods](https://github.com/jpshackelford/.openhands/blob/main/plugins/voice-relay-workflow/skills/orchestrate.md) rule.
- The 2026-05-22 livelock (jpshackelford/.openhands#22) is exactly the failure mode this gate prevents — no point polling every 15 minutes when only a human can unblock the backlog.

**Disable confirmation:**

```
PATCH https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/5f180989-ed9c-42b4-ac9f-5f30f0623316
→ {"id":"5f180989-…","name":"Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator v2","enabled":false}
```

**Re-enable path — humans take it from here:**

The on-hold backlog is gated on **manual verification of the production rollback** (PR #359 → vr.chorecraft.net) and on the S3-bucket design-freeze for #298–#302 (see [AGENTS.md → Active design freeze](AGENTS.md)). Concretely, a human should:

1. **Verify the rollback on prod** per the 02:52Z merge-worker entry — a kiosk that was stuck `connecting` should reach `state=connected`, and an iPhone utterance should round-trip TTS.
2. If verified green, **remove `on-hold` from #358** (forward-fix for the driver-contract bug). That alone unblocks the implementation worker.
3. **Re-enable the automation** via either:
   - UI: https://app.all-hands.dev/automations → "Voice Relay Workflow Orchestrator v2" → toggle on, OR
   - API:
     ```bash
     curl -X PATCH "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/5f180989-ed9c-42b4-ac9f-5f30f0623316" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"enabled": true}'
     ```
4. (Optional, but recommended) reset `quiet_ticks` to `0` in `.workflow-state.json` at the same time, so the very next productive cron tick doesn't have to reset it itself.

**Issues #299/#300/#302** stay `on-hold` independently until the S3-bucket provisioning prerequisites in AGENTS.md are met — those have their own re-enable path and are not gated on this re-enable.

### 2026-05-29 12:17 UTC - Orchestrator (manual `/orchestrate`)

🚀 **Spawned: 4 Expansion Workers (parallel)**

User filed 5 fresh server-side issues (#360–#364) at 12:07Z documenting a production bug cluster — the post-rollback (PR #359) recurrence + newly-discovered root causes. Automation had auto-disabled at 03:21Z; user re-enabled it and manually invoked `/orchestrate`. Plenty of productive work, so `quiet_ticks` reset 2 → 0.

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`f59f459`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f59f4590edad4287a5113e706bad98a9) | expansion | Issue #360 — sandbox PAUSED state not handled (priority:critical) | **NEW** |
| [`49f858d`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/49f858dd0eab4d419c347de548edc7bd) | expansion | Issue #361 — rebindConversation parses wrong response shape (priority:high) | **NEW** |
| [`1a415b1`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/1a415b196c5942c4b4af78621a5c9811) | expansion | Issue #362 — openSession silently discards opts on subsequent calls (priority:high) | **NEW** |
| [`2996e5b`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2996e5b9252b4a299afb18683ec8a77c) | expansion | Issue #363 — persist AISession state in DB (priority:medium) | **NEW** |

**Current State:**

- Open PRs: 0
- Issues needing expansion: #360, #361, #362, #363 (all dispatched above), **#364** (priority:low, deferred — only 4 expansion slots and this is the lowest-priority of the 5 new issues; will be picked up next tick)
- Ready issues: #351 only (carries `on-hold`, skip)
- Implementation slot: 0/1 used (no `ready` issues to act on — the entire ready queue is gated on these expansions completing)
- Review slots: 0/2 used (no open PRs)

**Why all 4 expansion slots at once:**

The 5 new issues are tightly related — they all describe the same production failure mode (sandboxes pausing, kiosks degrading, rebind broken) from different angles. The reporter (@jpshackelford) has already done extensive root-cause analysis on each (#360 alone is ~5 KB of in-depth platform-API forensics). Running expansions in parallel gets the whole cluster ready for implementation simultaneously, instead of serializing 4×~15min ≈ 1h of wall time. #362 in particular is flagged as **"the latent #357 root cause"** — i.e. the underlying defect behind the rollback we shipped 9 hours ago — so getting it implementation-ready quickly matters for production stability.

**Notes for downstream workers:**

- Each expansion worker has been told to **read the referenced code, not just trust the issue text** — these are unusually well-analyzed issues but the analyses should still be validated against the actual `src/` files referenced.
- After expansion, issues #360–#363 should arrive at the implementation queue with `ready` labels. The implementation worker that picks #360 first (it's `priority:critical`) should sequence carefully — #361/#362 fix bugs that #360's fix may interact with on the rebind path.

### 2026-05-29 12:18 UTC - Expansion Worker (#362)

✅ **Expanded Issue #362** — _bug(server): OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession silently discards opts on subsequent calls (the latent #357 root cause)_

- Issue: [#362](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/362)
- Type: Bug
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied)
- Validation: Read `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts` at `ed43b64`. Confirmed @jpshackelford's analysis — `openSession` only assigns `state.opts` on the fresh-state branch (L389–399); the else branch never refreshes opts, so `doBindSession` (L604–625) and `restartSession` (L432–453) always see stale cached opts. `runTurn`'s lazy-bind path is also affected but less relevant for the immediate #358 retry pattern.
- Test gap: T-2.2.4 only exercises `openSession` with identical opts. No test covers different `existingConversationId` across calls — the exact gap that let the latent bug ship in #355/#356.
- Approach: Endorsed Option 1 (refresh `state.opts` on every call). Option 2 expands the driver interface unnecessarily; Option 3 forces `runTurn` to pass opts it doesn't have. Plus JSDoc tightening in `types.ts` and three new tests in `openhands.test.ts` (refresh-on-second-call, restartSession-uses-latest-opts, plus a comment tightening on T-2.2.4).
- Production safety: pure in-memory change, no DB/wire-format/API impact, safe for auto-deploy to vr.chorecraft.net. No behaviour change for current single-call callers; only unlocks correct behaviour for the future #358 retry helper.
- Sequencing: must land before #358 is re-attempted. Independent of #360/#361.

### 2026-05-29 12:18 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #360)

✅ **Expanded Issue #360** — `bug(server): sandbox PAUSED state not handled — kiosks degrade permanently ~4 min after idle`

- Issue: [#360](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/360)
- Type: Bug (priority:critical)
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied)
- Root cause **confirmed against `main` (ed43b64)**: `doRefreshSessionCredentials` in `server/src/openhands.ts` (~L1561) has no `PAUSED` branch; a paused conversation has `session_api_key: null`, so it falls through to the existing `!fresh.session_api_key` guard → `SandboxMissingError` → rebind, which can't recover a paused sandbox. Existing #291 test suite has zero `sandbox_status: 'PAUSED'` cases — gap that let the bug ship.
- Approach: Add `OpenHandsClient.resumeSandbox(sandboxId)` (POST `/api/v1/sandboxes/{id}/resume`), new `SandboxResumeTimeoutError`, a `PAUSED` branch in `doRefreshSessionCredentials` that calls resume + a new `pollSandboxRunning` helper, capped by a 2nd `RebindWindowTracker` instance (`resumeTracker`, same 3-in-5-min cap). Existing MISSING/401 paths and PR #354's rebind logic stay intact as fallbacks; this is strictly additive. Server-only TS change — no DB/migration/client work, safe for vr.chorecraft.net auto-deploy. Implementation comment with file-by-file plan, test matrix (8 cases), and production-safety notes posted at https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/360#issuecomment-4574874405.

### 2026-05-29 12:21 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #363)

✅ **Expanded Issue #363** — `feat(server): persist operational AISession state in DB instead of holding it only in-memory`

- Issue: [#363](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/363)
- Type: Enhancement (priority:medium, scope:server-only)
- Status: `ready` + `on-hold` (depends on #360 + #362 merging first)
- Validation: read `server/src/openhands.ts` (AISession L491, AISessionManager L1401, rebindTracker L1442), `server/src/agent-driver/rebind.ts:330` (RebindWindowTracker), `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts:321` (DriverSessionState.states), `server/src/sessions/persist-ai-conversation-id.ts`, `server/src/agent-rehydrate.ts`, and the migration registry. Reporter's analysis matches the code.
- Approach refinement: **new `session_ai_state` table** preferred over extending `sessions.metadata` (the JSON blob already mediates display/TTS/aiConversationId via read-modify-write `updateMetadata` — adding a hot state machine there would race). Migration is additive (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + one-shot `INSERT OR IGNORE` backfill from existing `aiConversationId` rows with state=`running`). State enum is the *durable-lifecycle* vocab (`running|degraded|rebinding|ended`), deliberately distinct from the driver-emitted `AgentSessionState` (`absent|starting|ready|thinking|reconnecting|degraded`); the two are mapped at the surface.
- Architectural payoff: ~12 scattered `session.degraded = true` writes in `openhands.ts` get replaced with a single `transitionTo(session, state, reason)` chokepoint that write-throughs to the new repo.
- `RebindWindowTracker` budget persisted via `rebind_attempts_json` so the 3-in-5-min cap survives restart — directly addresses the deploy-thrash failure mode.
- Rehydration policy on startup: `running` re-attach (existing behavior), `degraded` skip + broadcast degraded session-state, `rebinding` retry-once-with-backoff, `ended` skip.
- Out of scope (deferred): `lastEventId` resume (currently dead field), `taskId` audit trail, multi-node leader election, `session_api_key` persistence (explicitly excluded).
- Production safety for auto-deploy: additive schema only, optional DI seam (`aiStateRepository?`) so missing repo degrades to today's in-memory-only behavior, migrator runs before `rehydrateAgentSessions`, no new env vars.
- on-hold rationale: needs #360 (PAUSED handling) merged so the persisted state machine sees real failure-mode transitions, and #362 (opts-cache fix) merged so rehydrate-via-`existingConversationId` doesn't inherit the lie.
- Detailed implementation plan with file-by-file changes, repo type signatures, migration DDL, and test strategy (repo unit + restart-simulation integration + tracker-survival) posted at https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/363#issuecomment-4574909211.

### 2026-05-29 12:25 UTC - Expansion Worker (#361)

✅ **Expanded Issue #361** — _bug(server): OpenHandsClient.rebindConversation parses the wrong response shape — rebind is effectively always broken_

- Issue: [#361](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/361)
- Type: Bug
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied)
- Validation: Read `server/src/openhands.ts:244–350` and `server/src/agent-driver/rebind.ts:180–301`. Confirmed @jpshackelford's analysis end-to-end — `OpenHandsClient.rebindConversation` (L334) types the POST `/app-conversations` response as `ConversationInfo` but the platform returns `StartTaskResponse`. `normalizeRebindResponse` always throws `OpenHandsApiError(0, "missing session_api_key")` which is `transient=true`, the outer loop re-POSTs up to 5x creating orphan start-tasks, eventually a non-transient 4xx surfaces as `RebindForbidden` → the exact `"Not authorized to recover the agent runtime — restart needed"` prod log line.
- Test gap: `rebind.test.ts:259 'malformed response (no session_api_key) is transient → retries'` documents the buggy behavior as if it were correct. The fixture `okResponse()` is a fake synchronous shape, not the real `AppConversationStartTask`. No test exercises the actual `OpenHandsClient.rebindConversation` HTTP boundary.
- Approach: Endorsed Option B (make rebind follow the async start-task → poll → get pattern that `startConversation` already uses at L1751–1788). Option A (delete the path) is bigger surface and #358 may still need it. Plus a recommendation to bump `REBIND_BUDGET_MS` from 30s → ≥120s since the legitimate rebind now includes a 10–60s sandbox boot inside one attempt.
- Production safety: no DB/schema changes. Rebind happy-path now takes 30–90s vs. <2s fail — net user-visible improvement (kiosks actually recover). UI's `session.rebinding` spinner from #294 covers the longer reconnecting window. Existing rebind-window guard (3 in 5min) still caps cascade risk.
- Sequencing: per issue body, land after #360 (PAUSED → resume covers 95% of prod failures). #361 unblocks the ENDED/MISSING tail and #358 if it ends up calling `rebindConversation`. Independent of #362.

### 2026-05-29 12:30 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #363 follow-up)

✅ **Restructured body of Issue #363** to standard `Problem Statement / Proposed Solution / Acceptance Criteria / Out of Scope / Sequencing & Dependencies` template. Preserved all technical content from the original filing (motivation, in-memory field audit, schema sketch, non-goals) — only the section headings/layout changed. The prior expansion worker's [detailed implementation plan comment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/363#issuecomment-4574909211) remains the source of truth for files-to-touch, migration DDL, repository signatures, and test strategy.

- Code-walk re-verified: `AISession` L491, `AISessionManager` L1401, `sessionAI` Map L1403, `OpenHandsAgentDriver.states` L321, `RebindWindowTracker` L330 — all references in the prior expansion are accurate against current `main`.
- Confirmed next migration number is `016` (latest in tree is `015_kiosk_footer_tickers.ts`).
- Labels unchanged: `ready` + `on-hold` (depends on #360 + #362).
- Posted verification comment: https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/363#issuecomment-4574969062

### 2026-05-29 12:35 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #364)

✅ **Expanded Issue #364** — `feat(server): include HTTP status + body excerpt in refresh/rebind failure logs`.

- Type: Enhancement (server-side observability).
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied).
- Approach: Add a `body: string | null` field to `OpenHandsApiError` (`server/src/openhands.ts:108`) and `RebindForbidden` / `RebindConversationGone` (`server/src/agent-driver/rebind.ts:95,110`) so call sites no longer have to regex the message string. A new helper `server/src/agent-driver/log.ts` (`redactSecrets` + `truncate` + `logUpstreamFailure`) is invoked from the four catch sites: `doRefreshSessionCredentials`, `doRebindSession`, `attachExistingForSession`, and `buildRebindReplaySuffix`. Emits one `console.error` per failure with `op=`, `status=`, `body="…"` (≤200 chars, with `session_api_key` / `api_key` / Bearer tokens redacted), conv/session/sandbox ids, attempt counter, and endpoint. User-facing `degradedReason` strings are explicitly preserved (regression-tested).
- Issue body restructured to the standard `Problem Statement / Proposed Solution / Acceptance Criteria / Out of Scope` template.
- Detailed implementation plan + acceptance criteria + file table + test plan posted at https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/364#issuecomment-4574974766.

### 2026-05-29 12:33 UTC - Implementation Worker (#360 PAUSED sandbox handling)

✅ **PR #365 opened (ready for review): fix(server): handle PAUSED sandbox via resume primitive (#360)**

Implements the PAUSED branch in `AISessionManager.doRefreshSessionCredentials`
that was missing — the 100%-failure-after-idle bug @jpshackelford filed as
`priority:critical`.

**Changes:**

| File | Δ |
|---|---|
| `server/src/openhands.ts` | + `resumeSandbox()` client method; + `SandboxResumeTimeoutError` / `SandboxResumeBudgetExhausted`; + PAUSED branch with `pollSandboxRunning` helper + `applyFreshCreds` extraction; + `sandboxResumeCount` metric; reconnect path catches resume errors → degrade cleanly |
| `server/src/openhands.test.ts` | + 14 new tests under `…PAUSED handling (#360)` covering happy path, STARTING poll loop, no-sandbox-id, resume 404, 5xx transient retry, poll timeout, MISSING during poll, budget exhausted, concurrent single-flighting, null-client, log line, RUNNING dormancy, error metadata |
| `docs/openhands-platform.md` | + § "Resume on a paused conversation (preferred over rebind when applicable)" |

**CI:** All checks green — Server Tests (1223/1223 pass), Client Tests,
Build Client, E2E Tests, enable-orchestrator, lint-pr-title.
`pr-review` was skipped while PR was draft; firing now post-ready-flip.

**Coverage:** `server/src/openhands.ts` — 94.07% lines / 87.43% branches
(well above the 80% target for new code).

**Acceptance criteria:** All code-side criteria met (PAUSED auto-recovery,
agent memory preserved, conversation_id unchanged, no DB changes, test
matrix covered). Manual `vr.chorecraft.net` smoke is the last item —
post-deploy task for @jpshackelford.

**Related issues NOT auto-closed:** #361 (rebind response-shape) and
#362 (openSession) touch the same `reconnectWithRefresh` / `rebindSession`
code paths. They remain valid as the fallback path's failure modes and
are tracked separately as `priority:high`.

| `f6f7c0e` | review | PR #365 — pollSandboxRunning suggestion | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Review Worker**
- PR: [#365 — fix(server): handle PAUSED sandbox via resume primitive (#360)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/365)
- Conversation: [`f6f7c0e`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f6f7c0e436b2413d92ae5225f2235343)
- Trigger: 1 unresolved `pr-review` thread on `server/src/openhands.ts:1856` (🟡 Suggestion — `pollSandboxRunning` should check before the initial sleep to avoid an unnecessary `resumePollIntervalMs` delay when the sandbox is already RUNNING). Legitimate low-risk latency/readability improvement — worker will evaluate and apply.

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: 1
  - [PR #365](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/365): `oR green ready 💬1` — CI 7/7 green; 1 bot review thread to address
- Ready issues (eligible, by priority):

  - #362 priority:high — queued

- Issues needing expansion: none 🎉

**Slot Utilization:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 1/2.

**Action:** Spawned review worker for PR #365. Implementation slot still occupied by `3940488` per API (PR #365 already opened — worker likely in final wrap-up).

### 2026-05-29 12:55 UTC - Review worker (PR #365 round 1)

✅ Addressed pr-review bot 🟡 Suggestion on `server/src/openhands.ts:1856`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| PR | [#365](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/365) |
| Branch | `fix/360-paused-sandbox-resume` |
| Commit | `e95ba56` — fix(server): check-then-sleep in pollSandboxRunning |
| CI | 7/7 green (Build/Client/Server/E2E/lint all pass) |
| Threads resolved | 1/1 (`PRRT_kwDOSTUWGM6FrkCH`) |

**Change:** Restructured `pollSandboxRunning` so the loop checks first and sleeps only between iterations. Saves up to one `resumePollIntervalMs` (~2s in prod) on the happy path where the sandbox has already reached RUNNING by the time we poll. Transient HTTP errors still wait before retry. All 213 server tests pass.

**Cross-issue impact:** None — #361 (rebind response shape) and #362 (openSession opts) don't have polling loops, so the check-then-sleep insight doesn't carry over.

**Next:** PR is back in `ready for review`. Awaiting next review pass.

- Worker will: re-verify CI/mergeability, polish PR description, squash-merge with `fix(server): handle PAUSED sandbox via resume primitive (#360)`, confirm #360 auto-closes.

**Cleared finished workers (moved to `.workflow-state.json` completed[]):**
- `3940488` impl/#360 → success (Created PR #365)
- `f6f7c0e` review/#365 → success (Addressed pr-review suggestion in commit `e95ba56`; CI green; thread `PRRT_kwDOSTUWGM6FrkCH` resolved)

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: 1
  - [PR #365](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/365): `oRFC green ready 💬--` — merging now
- Ready issues (eligible, by priority):
  - #360 priority:critical — merge in flight
  - #361 priority:high — queued (waiting for #365 to merge; touches same `reconnectWithRefresh` path → defer to avoid pre-merge conflicts)
  - #362 priority:high — queued (touches same `openSession`/rebind code path)
  - #364 priority:low — queued
- Ready issues on `on-hold` (skipped): #351 priority:low, #363 priority:medium
- Issues needing expansion: none 🎉
- Other on-hold (skipped): #210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #358

**Decision rationale for impl slot:** Held open this tick. #361/#362 both modify the same `reconnectWithRefresh` / `rebindSession` code paths PR #365 just rewrote — spawning an impl worker now would branch from pre-merge `main` and almost certainly conflict on squash. Next tick (after #365 lands) the impl slot will pick up #361 (priority:high, first in queue) against the updated `main`.

**Slot Utilization:** expansion 0/4, implementation 0/1, review 1/2 (merge worker).

**Deploy expectation:** vr.chorecraft.net auto-deploys from main. Watch for `deploy-success-bb863d1…` tag and the `[AI] sandbox resumed for conversation …` log line to confirm the PAUSED branch is firing in prod. `getSandboxResumeCount()` metric should start incrementing as kiosks recover from ~4-min idle pauses without operator intervention.

**Cross-issue note:** Issues [#361](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/361) (rebind response shape) and [#362](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/362) (openSession opts) touch the same `reconnectWithRefresh` / `rebindSession` code paths and remain valid as the fallback-path failure modes — **not closed** by this merge. With PR #365 landed, the impl slot can safely pick up #361 next tick against the updated `main`.

| `0f33642` | implementation | Issue #361 — rebindConversation response shape | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#361 — bug(server): OpenHandsClient.rebindConversation parses the wrong response shape — rebind is effectively always broken](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/361) (priority:high, scope:server-only)
- Conversation: [`0f33642`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/0f33642d25364c9e8f31a1fdbe81d7ad)
- Start task: `b37b2370…` → READY in <5s; sandbox RUNNING; execution_status running.
- Trigger: PR #365 merged last tick (`bb863d1`), impl slot freed, #361 is the highest-priority unblocked ready issue. Worker briefed on the post-#365 `server/src/openhands.ts` baseline so it rebases its mental model before branching, and asked to keep the diff focused so #362 can land cleanly after it.

**Cleared finished worker (moved to `.workflow-state.json` completed[]):**
- `0fd383a` merge/PR #365 → success (squash-merged `bb863d1`; #360 auto-closed; no migrations)

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: 0 (PR #365 merged at 13:06Z)
- Ready issues (eligible, by priority):
  - #361 priority:high — **in flight (impl `0f33642`)**
  - #362 priority:high — queued (touches adjacent `OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession` path; held until #361 lands to avoid pre-merge conflicts on `server/src/openhands.ts`)
  - #364 priority:low — queued
- Ready issues on `on-hold` (skipped): #351 priority:low, #363 priority:medium
- Issues needing expansion: all 6 unexpanded issues are `on-hold` (#210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302) → nothing to expand
- All workspace-persistence issues (#299–#302) remain frozen per AGENTS.md (Path B, awaiting `VR_WORKSPACE_BUCKET` + AWS creds on prod `.env`)

**Slot Utilization:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 0/2.

**Decision rationale:**
- Implementation slot was the only free productive slot. #361 picked over #362 because both are priority:high and #361 was filed first; the two have overlapping touch areas on `server/src/openhands.ts`/`agent-driver/rebind.ts`, so serializing #361 → #362 is safer than running them in parallel against the same module.
- Review/expansion slots intentionally idle: zero open PRs, zero eligible unexpanded issues.

### 2026-05-29 13:36 UTC - Implementation Worker (#361 → PR #367)

✅ **PR #367 opened for #361 (rebind response shape) — CI green, ready for review.**

- PR: [#367 — fix(server): rebindConversation drives three-phase async dance](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/367)
- Branch: `fix/361-rebind-response-shape`
- Closes: #361

**Diff summary:**
- `server/src/openhands.ts` — rewrite `OpenHandsClient.rebindConversation` to POST start-task → `pollUntilReady` → `getConversation` (the same three-phase dance as `startConversation`). Resolves the root cause: `POST /app-conversations` returns `AppConversationStartTask`, not `AppConversation`, so the old code's `info.session_api_key` read was always `undefined`.
- `server/src/agent-driver/rebind.ts` — bump `REBIND_BUDGET_MS` from 30 s → 180 s. Each rebind attempt now legitimately consumes sandbox-boot time; the 3-in-5-min `RebindWindowTracker` still caps cascade risk.
- `server/src/openhands-client.test.ts` — **new** HTTP-boundary test file (10 tests) covering: three-phase dance with realistic `AppConversationStartTask` shape, `system_message_suffix` forwarding, fallback to input id when start-task omits `app_conversation_id`, 503/403 error propagation, `getConversation`-returns-null edge case, `pollUntilReady` ERROR / timeout propagation.
- `server/src/agent-driver/rebind.test.ts` — `okResponse()` docstring clarifies the post-`getConversation` shape; budget-exhaustion tests pin `budgetMs: 30_000` so attempts-count assertions remain deterministic under the new 180 s default.

**CI:** Server / Client / Build / E2E / lint-pr-title / enable-orchestrator all passing. Full server suite: 1,233 passed. Coverage `openhands.ts` 92.13%, `rebind.ts` 96.51%.

**No DB / schema changes.**

**Cross-impact on #362:** none — #362 touches `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts::OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession`, which this PR does not modify. The two PRs should rebase cleanly.

- Ready issues (eligible, by priority):
  - #362 priority:high — **still queued** behind #367 to avoid overlapping edits to `server/src/openhands.ts`; safe to dispatch next tick once #367 merges

**Slot Utilization:** expansion 0/4, implementation 0/1 (deliberately idle — held until #367 lands to avoid `openhands.ts` conflicts), review 1/2 (merge worker for #367).

**Decision rationale:**
- Merge worker, not review worker: review body says "Safe to merge / Worth merging" with no CHANGES_REQUESTED decision and zero unresolved line-level threads. The three improvement opportunities are in the review body only (narrative); the worker has discretion to apply them if trivial.
- Implementation slot intentionally idle: #362 and #364 both touch `server/src/openhands.ts` which PR #367 rewrites; dispatching now would create a guaranteed rebase. Pattern matches the prior orchestrator note from the 13:21Z tick.
- Worklog truncation: file is 421 lines but archive script reports "nothing to archive" — all current entries fall inside the most recent 6h productive window. No archive commit needed this tick.

**`quiet_ticks` reset:** 1 → 0 (this tick is productive: spawned merge worker).

### 2026-05-29 13:58 UTC - Merge Worker (PR #367 — fix/361-rebind-response-shape)

✅ **Merged PR #367 (squash) → main:** `fix(server): rebindConversation drives three-phase async dance (#367)` at merge commit [`002f38f`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/002f38f40de55062eccb00c6ac1610182fb674f7). Closes #361 (auto-closed via "Closes #361" in PR body).

| Phase | Result |
|---|---|
| Diff study | Three-phase POST → `pollUntilReady` → `getConversation` correctly implemented in `server/src/openhands.ts`; `REBIND_BUDGET_MS` 30 s → 180 s bump intentional + documented with cascade-cap rationale (`MAX_REBINDS_PER_WINDOW = 3` in `RebindWindowTracker` still bounds blast radius). |
| Migration check | ✅ No migration / schema changes (`server/src/storage/migrations` untouched). Production SQLite (`sqlite.db`) unaffected. |
| Review polish | Applied all three trivial nits from review body in commit [`0a3e346`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/0a3e346): (1) `??` over `||` on L425 for `app_conversation_id` fallback, (2) `string \| null` on the `StartTaskResponse.app_conversation_id` field type to match test fixtures + platform reality, (3) inline comment explaining 120 s `pollUntilReady` timeout sits inside 180 s `REBIND_BUDGET_MS` envelope. Server suite still green locally (35/35 in targeted run, `tsc --noEmit` clean). |
| Post-polish CI | Server Tests ✅ · Client Tests ✅ · Build Client ✅ · E2E Tests ✅ · lint-pr-title ✅ — all green on `0a3e346`. |
| PR body | Updated with "Review polish" section + "Post-deploy monitoring" note (per review's risk-assessment recommendation: track rebind duration p50/p95/p99 to validate 10–60 s sandbox-boot assumption and tune `REBIND_BUDGET_MS` if real-world boots cluster outside that band). |
| Merge | `gh pr merge 367 --squash` ✓. Merge commit body summarises root cause (response-shape mismatch), three-phase fix, and the budget-bump rationale. |
| #361 close | ✅ auto-closed at 13:57:40 UTC. |

🚦 **Unblocks downstream work:** `server/src/openhands.ts` has now landed on `main`, so issue **#362 (`openSession` opts, priority:high)** is no longer blocked by the rebase-risk that kept it queued behind #367 the past two ticks. Same goes for #364 (priority:low). Next orchestrator tick can dispatch #362 to the implementation slot without contention.

🚀 **Production impact:** auto-deploys to `vr.chorecraft.net` on this push to main. Fixes the 100%-broken rebind path (response-shape parse bug → reconnect failure). UI behaviour change: "reconnecting" spinner can now stretch to ~3 min on a recoverable rebind (vs ~30 s before falsely transitioning to `degraded`) — kiosk already renders the spinner per #294.

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#362 — bug(server): OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession silently discards opts on subsequent calls](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/362) (priority:high, scope:server-only)
- Conversation: [`77291da`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/77291daf274d430092217216d3ebb8c2)
- Start task: `dd1a84d0…` → READY on first poll; sandbox RUNNING; execution_status `running`.
- Trigger: PR #367 merged (commit `002f38f`, 13:57Z) cleared the `server/src/openhands.ts` rebase-risk that had kept #362 queued behind it for the past two ticks. #362 has been the priority:high ready issue throughout.
- Worker brief: implements `openSession` opts-preservation fix per the expanded issue body + technical-approach comment from expansion worker `1a415b1`. Branch starts fresh off main so the just-landed three-phase rebind code is picked up cleanly.

**Cleared finished worker (moved to `.workflow-state.json` completed[]):**
- `d467e98` merge/PR #367 → success (squash `002f38f`; #361 closed; review-body nits applied in `0a3e346`).

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: 0 (PR #367 merged 13:57Z; #361 auto-closed)
- Ready issues (eligible, by priority):
  - #362 priority:high — **now being implemented** by `77291da`
  - #364 priority:low — queued; touches the same `server/src/openhands.ts` failure-log call sites, so serialize after #362 to avoid rebase churn
- Ready issues on `on-hold` (skipped): #351 priority:low, #363 priority:medium
- Issues needing expansion: all 6 unexpanded issues are `on-hold` (#210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302) → nothing to expand
- All workspace-persistence issues (#299–#302) remain frozen per AGENTS.md (Path B, awaiting `VR_WORKSPACE_BUCKET` + AWS creds on prod `.env`)

**Slot Utilization:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 0/2.

**Decision rationale:**
- Implementation slot was the only productive slot to dispatch. #362 picked over #364 because #362 is priority:high (vs `low`) and #364 is a small log-formatting nit that benefits from waiting for #362 to land.
- Review slot intentionally idle: zero open PRs.
- Expansion slot intentionally idle: every unexpanded issue carries `on-hold`. Picking up an on-hold issue would violate the AGENTS.md soft-guard policy.
- Worklog truncation: file is 478 lines. Most recent ~6h of productive entries (impl #361 → merge #367 → this tick) sit inside the truncation script's keep-window, but earlier 2026-05-29 status ticks may now be archivable. Skipped this tick to keep the spawn commit small; will revisit on the next quiet tick.

**`quiet_ticks` reset:** 0 → 0 (this tick is productive: spawned impl worker).

### 2026-05-29 14:13 UTC - Implementation Worker (#362)

🚧 **PR #368 opened (now ready for review)** — [fix(server): refresh opts on every OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession call](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/368)

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Branch | `fix/362-opensession-opts-discarded` off fresh `main` at `1e88fbe` (picks up #367's three-phase rebind cleanly; no conflicts). |
| Fix | Two-line `state.opts = opts` on the `else` branch of `OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession` (`server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts`), plus a comment pointing at #362 / #357 for future readers. Latest opts always replace cached values; upstream bind is still single-flight + idempotent via `mgr.hasSessionAI` / `lazyBindSession`. |
| JSDoc | `AgentDriver.openSession` doc in `server/src/agent-driver/types.ts` rewritten to spell out the contract: latest opts win, upstream bind single-flight, refreshed opts observed by next `restartSession` / lazy-bind. |
| Tests | +2 (and tightened wording on T-2.2.4). Both new tests **confirmed failing on pre-fix code** (stash-and-rerun): `expected 'conv-old' to be undefined` and `expected 'conv-A' to be undefined` — exactly the stale-attach pathology described in the issue. Both pass after the fix. |
| Test suite | `npm test -w server` → 1235 / 1235 across 57 files; `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. |
| CI | Server Tests ✅ · Client Tests ✅ · Build Client ✅ · E2E Tests ✅ · lint-pr-title ✅ · enable-orchestrator ✅. All green. |
| Acceptance criteria | All 5 from issue body met (see PR description for the per-AC mapping). |
| Migration check | ✅ No DB / schema changes (pure in-memory state refresh). Auto-deploy to `vr.chorecraft.net` safe. |
| Draft → Ready | Marked ready at 14:13 UTC after green CI; review-bot dispatch is the next orchestrator concern. |

📌 **Follow-ups noted:**
- The fix is observable in production only when a caller actually invokes `openSession` twice with different opts. No code path does that today — the #348/#358 helper that exercised it was rolled back in #357. The unblocking is for **future** work: re-attempt of #358 (fresh-create fallback for `MISSING` / `ERROR` sandboxes once #365's resume path is exhausted) and any other retry-with-different-opts pattern.
- Per the orchestrator note, **#364 is now unblocked** for sequencing — it touches the same `server/src/openhands.ts` failure-log call sites and was being serialized after #362 to avoid rebase churn. Now that #362's diff is small and isolated to `agent-driver/`, the rebase risk for #364 is minimal.

### 2026-05-29 14:23 UTC - Merge Worker (PR #368)

✅ **PR #368 squash-merged to `main`** — [fix(server): refresh opts on every OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession call (#368)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/368) at merge commit [`c6275e7`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/c6275e7c93cd3580ab78afa74ba8074476c87681).

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Pre-merge state | `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`, labels empty (no `on-hold`, no `needs-human`), all 6 required CI checks ✅ (Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator). |
| Automated review | 🟢 LOW risk, ✅ Worth merging, "Elegant, minimal fix" — zero CHANGES_REQUESTED, zero line-level threads, zero nits to apply. |
| Diff review | 3 files, +63 / −2: two-line `state.opts = opts` on the else branch of `OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession` in `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.ts`, JSDoc rewrite on `AgentDriver.openSession` in `server/src/agent-driver/types.ts`, +2 new tests (and a tightened T-2.2.4) in `server/src/agent-driver/openhands.test.ts`. Pure in-memory state refresh. |
| Migration check | ✅ No DB / schema / migration / API / wire format changes — confirmed by `git diff --name-only` (no `*.sql`, no `migrations/`, nothing touching `server/src/db/`). Auto-deploy to `vr.chorecraft.net` is safe. |
| Label re-check | Re-checked labels immediately before invoking `gh pr merge` — still empty. No abort. |
| Squash commit | Conventional-commit title `fix(server): refresh opts on every OpenHandsAgentDriver.openSession call (#368)`; body summarises root cause, fix, no-DB-changes, and `Closes #362`. |
| Issue closure | #362 auto-closed by `Closes #362` trailer — verified via `gh issue view 362` → `state: CLOSED`. No manual close needed. |
| Post-deploy monitoring | Not strictly required. The fix is only observable when callers invoke `openSession` twice with different opts; no production code path does that today (the #348/#358 helper was rolled back in #357). The unblocking is for the future #358 re-attempt and any retry-with-different-opts helper. |

📌 **Follow-up sequencing:** #364 (failure-log call sites in `server/src/openhands.ts`) was being serialized after #362 to avoid rebase churn — now unblocked. The #358 re-attempt (fresh-create fallback for MISSING / ERROR sandboxes) can also proceed once #365's resume path lands.
