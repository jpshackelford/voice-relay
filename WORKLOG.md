# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

- Status: **MERGED** ✅
- Issue #156: **CLOSED** (auto-closed via "Fixes #156")

**Commit Message:**
```
docs: replace vr.chorecraft.net with app.no-hands.dev

Migrates all domain references from the legacy vr.chorecraft.net to the
new production domain app.no-hands.dev:

- Update .env.example with new BASE_URL and relative SQLITE_PATH
- Update CI workflow health checks and smoke test URLs
- Update all test fixtures to use new domain
- Mark legacy infrastructure documentation as deprecated
- Preserve server paths in docs for historical reference

Fixes #156
```

**Summary:**
- 12 files changed across config, tests, and documentation
- All active code references updated to app.no-hands.dev
- Legacy server paths (e.g., /var/www/vr.chorecraft.net/app) retained for historical reference
- CI/CD now targets new production URL for smoke tests
- Documentation clearly marks old domain as deprecated

**Production Impact:**
- App auto-deploys to app.no-hands.dev on merge to main
- No database migrations required (docs/config change only)

| `TVOS_JS_SANDBOX_RESEARCH.md:17` | 🟡 Suggestion | WKWebView sources are from 2015-2016 (10+ years old), need current verification | ✅ Added verification note citing current Apple SDK documentation |

**Research Findings:**
- **Verified via Apple's official SDK documentation (May 2026):**
  - [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview): Lists iOS 8.0+, iPadOS 8.0+, Mac Catalyst 13.1+, macOS 10.10+, visionOS 1.0+ — **tvOS NOT listed**
  - [WebView SwiftUI struct](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebKit/WebView-swift.struct) (WWDC25): Also excludes tvOS from supported platforms
- **Conclusion:** WKWebView remains unavailable on tvOS — architecture recommendation (React Native tvOS) remains valid

- Issue: [#139 - [Research] Safely render AI-generated JavaScript apps on kiosk](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/139)
- Merge commit: Squash merged to main
- Issue #139: **Auto-closed** ✅

**Summary:**
Documentation-only change adding `/docs/TVOS_JS_SANDBOX_RESEARCH.md` with comprehensive research findings:

- **Key Constraint:** WKWebView is NOT supported on tvOS (verified May 2026 against Apple SDK docs)
- **Recommendation:** React Native tvOS for cross-platform consistency with web kiosk
- **Architecture:** AI generates declarative component trees (data), not executable JavaScript
- **Security Model:** "Data not code" - natural sandboxing without arbitrary code execution risks
- **Example:** Complete Lemonade Stand game showing declarative UI with voice interaction

**Conventional Commit:**
```
docs: add tvOS JavaScript sandbox research for voice-driven apps

Closes #139
```

**Deploy:** Auto-deploys to app.no-hands.dev on merge to main

🎉 **Issue #139 Complete** - Research phase done, ready for implementation (Phase 1: Web Kiosk MVP)
