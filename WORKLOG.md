# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

**Current backlog:**
- [#9 - F1: Scope messages to sessions](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/9)
- [#10 - F2: Replace Dashboard with Workspace Home](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/10)
- [#11 - F3: Session View (remove setup, auto-detect mode, QR idle state)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/11)
- [#12 - F4: Join session via QR code](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/12)

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

- Conversation: [`8002e73`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/8002e733d97240b6a3fa88cc86f46387)

**Review Issues to Address:**
1. 🔴 Critical: Missing `.ai-status` CSS class (button changed to div without CSS)
2. 🔴 Critical: Incomplete interface change (`sessionId` prop not passed from call sites)
3. 🟡 Suggestion: Guard against undefined `device.sessionId` in forwarding logic

**Current State:**
- PR #126: `oRC green ready 💬3` (CI green, 3 unresolved review threads)
- Issues after #122 closes: None (this is the last issue!)
- All issues expanded
- Expansion slot: Idle (nothing to expand)

✅ **Review Feedback Addressed: PR #126**

- PR: [#126 - chore: remove legacy device-centric AI code](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/126)
- Status: **Ready for merge** ✅

**Fixes Applied:**

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Missing `.ai-status` CSS class | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Fixed in `e3ead79` |
| `sessionId` prop not passed to MobileMode | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Fixed in `ca8a948` |
| Guard against undefined `device.sessionId` | 🟡 Suggestion | ✅ Fixed in `244d54a` |

**Commits:**
1. `e3ead79` - fix: add missing .ai-status CSS class for AI status indicator
2. `ca8a948` - fix: pass sessionId prop to MobileMode in SessionView
3. `244d54a` - refactor: make sessionId guard explicit in AI forwarding logic

**Technical Details:**
- Added `.ai-status` CSS class based on `.ai-toggle` but without interactive states
- SessionView.tsx now passes `sessionId` to MobileMode for consistency with KioskMode
- Workspace.tsx intentionally does NOT pass `sessionId` (operates without sessions - AI disabled)
- Flattened nested conditional structure in server forwarding logic for clarity

All 3 review threads resolved. CI passing. PR marked ready for review.

🚀 **Spawned: Expansion Worker**

- Issue: [#127 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/127)
- Conversation: [`e2559ce`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e2559ce0e7294f5c8994e1ff3d74e826)

**Issue Context:**
- Created by CI after smoke test failure on deployment
- Failed commit: `cc93b3350e9e0b8e7b9a5665e578b95a445ce1fe`
- Automatic rollback was initiated
- Expansion worker will investigate logs and identify root cause

**Housekeeping:**
- Archived 6 worklog entries to WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-15.md

**Current State:**
- No open PRs
- Issue #127 needs expansion (smoke test failure)

### 2026-05-15 18:10 UTC - Expansion Worker

✅ **Expanded Issue #127: Smoke test failure after deployment**

- Issue: [#127 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/127)
- Type: Bug (CI failure / test-code mismatch)
- Status: **Ready for implementation** ✅

**Root Cause:**
Smoke tests were not updated when PR #126 migrated from device-centric to session-centric AI architecture:
1. UI tests look for `.ai-toggle` button (removed), should use `.ai-status` indicator
2. API tests expect 400/404 from deprecated endpoints now returning 410 Gone
3. Tests assume manual AI connect/disconnect (now auto-connects per session)

**Failed Tests:** 9 of 28
- 5 UI element tests (selector `.ai-toggle` no longer exists)
- 4 API error handling tests (deprecated endpoints return 410)

**Proposed Fix:**
- Update `tests/smoke/ai-integration.spec.ts` selectors and expectations
- Remove/adapt manual toggle tests for session-centric auto-connect
- Update API tests to expect 410 for deprecated endpoints

**Complexity:** Medium

**Commits:**
- `8916d3b` - fix(tests): remove flawed .catch() from waitForAIAutoConnect helper

**Technical Details:**
- The `.catch()` block silently swallowed connection failures, making the helper always succeed
- Removed the `.catch()` so the helper properly fails when AI doesn't connect within timeout
- Callers already handle AI unavailability via status check and `test.skip()` - the error suppression was redundant

- Issue: [#127 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/127)
- Status: **Ready for merge** ✅

**Fixes Applied:**

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Test name misleading - "transitions through states" only tests final state | 🟠 Important | ✅ Removed duplicative test in `b87587c` |
| Redundant assertion - waitForAIAutoConnect already verifies visibility | 🟡 Suggestion | ✅ Fixed in `62467dc` |
| Same redundancy at another location | 🟡 Suggestion | ✅ Fixed in `62467dc` |
| Redundant CSS class inspection | 🟡 Suggestion | ✅ Resolved by test removal in `b87587c` |

**Commits:**
- `62467dc` - refactor(tests): remove redundant visibility assertions
- `b87587c` - refactor(tests): remove duplicative 'transitions through states' test

**Technical Details:**
- Removed redundant `await expect(aiStatus).toBeVisible()` calls after `waitForAIAutoConnect()` which already verifies visibility
- Removed entire "AI status indicator transitions through connecting states" test because:
  1. Name was misleading (only tested final state, not transitions)
  2. Duplicated the "AI status shows connected state after auto-connect" test
  3. Had redundant CSS class inspection (toHaveClass already confirms active)

✅ **Expanded Issue #129**

- Issue: [#129 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/129)
- Type: Bug
- Status: **Ready for implementation** ✅

**Root Cause Identified:**

The client-side wiring for session-centric AI status is incomplete:

| Component | Has | Missing |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| `useWebSocket.ts` | `onSessionAIStatusMessage` callback | |
| `useAI.ts` | `handleSessionAIStatus` handler | |
| `SessionView.tsx` | | NOT passing `onSessionAIStatusMessage` to WebSocket |
| `KioskMode.tsx` | `useAI({ sessionId })` | NOT receiving AI status from WebSocket |

**Why `.ai-status` never appears:**
1. Server broadcasts `session-ai-status` WebSocket messages ✓
2. Client receives messages but callback is `undefined` ✗
3. `ai.connecting` and `ai.connected` stay `false`
4. Conditional `{aiAvailable && (ai.connecting || ai.connected) && ...}` is never true
5. Element is never rendered

**Proposed Fix:**
- Wire `onSessionAIStatusMessage` from `SessionView.tsx` to `useWebSocket`
- Connect to `KioskMode` via props or lifted state
- Also wire `onAIThinkingMessage` for thinking indicator

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/pages/SessionView.tsx`
- `client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx`

**Labels:** `ready`, `bug`

- Priority: `priority:high` (CI failure bug)
- Conversation: [`2ac2fd2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2ac2fd2389224a98b22dbbcbf1c594fb)

**Root Cause (from expansion worker `8347c92`):**
Client-side wiring for session-centric AI status is incomplete:
- `useWebSocket.ts` has `onSessionAIStatusMessage` callback ✓
- `useAI.ts` has `handleSessionAIStatus` handler ✓
- `SessionView.tsx` NOT passing `onSessionAIStatusMessage` to WebSocket ✗
- `KioskMode.tsx` NOT receiving AI status from WebSocket ✗

**Expected Fix:**
1. Wire `onSessionAIStatusMessage` from `SessionView.tsx` to `useWebSocket`
2. Connect to `KioskMode` via props or lifted state
3. Also wire `onAIThinkingMessage` for thinking indicator

**Current State:**
- No open PRs (implementation worker will create one)
- All issues expanded and ready
- Expansion slot: Idle (nothing to expand)
- PR slot: Occupied (implementation worker)

✅ **PR Created: Issue #129 (smoke test failure)**

- Issue: [#129 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/129)
- PR: [#130 - fix(client): wire session AI status from WebSocket to KioskMode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/130)
- Status: **Ready for review** ✅

**Changes Implemented:**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `client/src/pages/SessionView.tsx` | Added `useAI` hook, wired handlers to `useWebSocket`, passed `ai` prop to `KioskMode` |
| `client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx` | Accept optional `ai` prop, removed internal `useAI` call, added optional chaining |
| `client/src/components/KioskMode.test.tsx` | Updated tests to pass `ai` as prop |

**Root Cause:**
The session-centric AI architecture (PR #126) added WebSocket message types and handlers, but the React component wiring in `SessionView.tsx` was never completed. The fix connects:
1. Server broadcasts `session-ai-status` messages
2. `useWebSocket` receives and forwards to callback
3. `useAI.handleSessionAIStatus` updates state
4. `KioskMode` renders `.ai-status` indicator

**Tests:**
- All 180 client tests passing ✅
- CI: All checks green ✅

✅ **Merged PR #130 → Issue #129 Closed**

- PR: [#130 - fix(client): wire session AI status from WebSocket to KioskMode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/130)
- Issue: [#129 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/129) - **CLOSED** (auto-closed via "Fixes #129")
- Merge type: Squash merge
- Commit: `552eca6`

**What was shipped:**
- Complete client-side wiring for session-centric AI status WebSocket messages
- `SessionView.tsx`: Initialize `useAI` hook, wire handlers to `useWebSocket`
- `KioskMode.tsx`: Accept AI state via props with optional chaining
- `useAI.ts`: Export `AIState` interface for type-safe prop passing
- Tests updated to use prop-based AI state

**Root Cause Fixed:**
PR #126 (session-centric AI) added WebSocket message types and handlers, but the React component wiring in `SessionView.tsx` was never completed. This fix connects:
1. Server broadcasts `session-ai-status` messages
2. `useWebSocket` receives and forwards to callback
3. `useAI.handleSessionAIStatus` updates state
4. `KioskMode` renders `.ai-status` indicator

**Review Evolution:**
- Initial implementation: 🟢 Good taste - addressed core wiring issue
- Feedback: Export `AIState` type to avoid drift
- Final: Type-safe implementation with exported interface

**Deployment:**
- Auto-deploying to vr.chorecraft.net
- Client-only changes - no database/migration impact
- No breaking changes (ai prop is optional)

**Session-centric AI Migration Complete:**
- ✅ Issue #119 (session-centric AI infrastructure) - MERGED
- ✅ Issue #120 (auto-connect AI when first device joins) - MERGED  
- ✅ Issue #121 (UI indicators for thinking/connecting) - MERGED
- ✅ Issue #122 (remove legacy device-centric code) - MERGED
- ✅ Issue #129 (smoke test wiring fix) - **MERGED**

**Current State:**
- No open issues 🎉
- No open PRs
- Smoke tests should now pass (`.ai-status` indicator wiring complete)

✅ **Expanded Issue #131**

- Issue: [#131 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/131)
- Type: Bug (CI failure)
- Status: Ready for implementation
- Labels: `ready`, `priority:high`, `bug`, `ci-failure`

**Root Cause:** When AI architecture changed from device-centric to session-centric (PRs #123, #124), the `senderName` for AI messages was inadvertently changed from `'✨ AI'` to `'AI Assistant'` in `server/src/auto-connect.ts:95`. The smoke test still expects the original `'✨ AI'` format.

**Proposed Fix:** Restore `senderName: '✨ AI'` in `auto-connect.ts` to match the original behavior and smoke test expectation.

**Files to modify:**
- `server/src/auto-connect.ts` - Change line 95
- `server/src/auto-connect.test.ts` - Update test assertion

✅ **PR Created: Issue #131**

- Issue: [#131 - 🚨 Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/131)
- PR: [#132 - fix: restore AI sender name to '✨ AI' for smoke test compatibility](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/132)
- Status: **Ready for review** ✅

**Changes Implemented:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `server/src/auto-connect.ts` | Changed `senderName: 'AI Assistant'` → `senderName: '✨ AI'` |
| `server/src/auto-connect.test.ts` | Updated test assertion to expect `'✨ AI'` |

**Root Cause Fixed:**
The session-centric AI refactor (PRs #123, #124) inadvertently changed the `senderName` for AI messages from `'✨ AI'` to `'AI Assistant'`. The smoke test at `tests/smoke/ai-integration.spec.ts:188` expects messages containing `'✨ AI'`, causing test failures after deployment.

**CI Status:**
- ✅ Build Client: Passed
- ✅ Server Tests: Passed (all 525 tests)
- ✅ E2E Tests: Passed
- ✅ Conventional Commits: Passed

**Risk Assessment:** Low - simple string change restoring original behavior.
