# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

### 2026-05-18 14:55 UTC - Review Worker (`0fadaec`)

✅ **PR #203 Merge Conflicts Resolved**

- **PR:** [#203 - feat: add audio streaming infrastructure for server-side transcription (Phase 1)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/203)
- **Issue:** [#166](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/166)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for merge

**Conflict Resolution:**
PR #202 (unified TTS settings) was merged to main while PR #203 (audio streaming) was open. Both PRs modified the same type definition files.

**Files with conflicts resolved:**
1. `client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Merged both TTS settings and audio streaming callbacks/refs
2. `client/src/types.ts` - Combined `SessionTtsSettings*` and `AudioInput*`/`Transcription*` message types
3. `server/src/types.ts` - Same as client types

**Resolution approach:**
- Rebased PR #203 branch onto latest main (commit `17555a1`)
- Retained all functionality from both PRs:
  - TTS settings: `SessionTtsSettingsMessage`, `SessionTtsSettingsChangedMessage`, `updateSessionTtsSettings`
  - Audio streaming: `AudioInputChunkMessage`, `AudioInputEndMessage`, `TranscriptionResultMessage`, `TranscriptionErrorMessage`, `sendAudioInputChunk`, `sendAudioInputEnd`

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build passes (client + server)
- ✅ Server tests: 616 passed
- ✅ Client tests: 413 passed
- ✅ CI: All 4 checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, Conventional Commits)
- ✅ PR status: MERGEABLE, no conflicts

**Commits after rebase:**
- `806ee41` - feat(audio): Add Phase 1 audio streaming infrastructure
- `7aa1e1d` - fix: address review feedback for audio streaming hook
- `e26ad23` - fix: prevent audio data loss on ring buffer overflow
- `cd7b25c` - fix: include current audio chunk when max duration exceeded

### 2026-05-18 15:44 UTC - Implementation Worker (`d55d893`)

✅ **PR #205 Created for Issue #204**

- **PR:** [#205 - feat(client): add unified input mode for voice + visualizer](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/205)
- **Issue:** [#204 - Mobile: Unify voice and visualizer modes with client-side STT](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/204)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for review

**Implementation Summary:**
Added new "Unified" input mode that combines Web Speech API transcription with oscilloscope visualization. Modern browsers handle two logical mic streams to the same physical microphone, so the Web Speech API and getUserMedia can coexist.

**Changes:**
1. Added `'unified'` to `InputMode` type: `'voice' | 'visualizer' | 'unified'`
2. Updated `MobileSettings` with three-button selector (Voice / Unified / Visualizer)
3. Updated `MobileMode` to handle unified mode:
   - Starts both Web Speech API and getUserMedia for oscilloscope
   - Shows oscilloscope in unified mode
   - Transcription auto-submits as in voice mode
4. Header toggle cycles: voice → unified → visualizer → voice
5. Added comprehensive tests for unified mode functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ New "Unified" input mode option in mobile settings
- ✅ Unified mode shows oscilloscope AND performs live transcription  
- ✅ Transcription auto-submits as it does in voice mode today
- ✅ Both streams clean up properly when stopped
- ⏳ Works on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (needs manual verification)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client tests: 407 passed
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ Build: Passes
- ✅ CI: All checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, Conventional Commits)

### 2026-05-18 15:55 UTC - Review Worker (`09881b0`)

✅ **PR #205 Review Feedback Addressed**

- **PR:** [#205 - feat(client): add unified input mode for voice + visualizer](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/205)
- **Issue:** [#204](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/204)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, All review threads resolved ✅, Ready for merge

**Review Feedback Addressed (3 threads → all resolved):**

1. **Extract stream cleanup logic** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - Extracted `cleanupAudioStream()` helper to reduce duplication
   - Now used consistently in mode change effect and handleMicToggle

2. **Extract getUserMedia + analyser start pattern** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - Extracted `startAudioVisualizer()` async helper
   - Centralizes the getUserMedia + analyser.start pattern for reuse

3. **Error handling could be more precise** (🟠 Important)
   - Unified mode now uses separate try-catch blocks
   - If speech recognition fails, returns early without starting visualizer
   - If visualizer fails after speech started, properly cleans up speech
   - Makes error handling explicit about what succeeded/failed

**Commit:** `c3fa7e1` - refactor(MobileMode): extract helpers and improve error handling

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client tests: 407 passed
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors

**PR is ready for merge.**

### 2026-05-18 15:50 UTC - Implementation Worker (`d14a3c8`)

✅ **PR #206 Created for Issue #167**

- **PR:** [#206 - feat(client): add toggle to show/hide agent actions from OpenHands event stream](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/206)
- **Issue:** [#167 - Add toggle to show/hide agent actions from OpenHands event stream](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/167)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for review ✅

**Implementation Summary:**
Added collapsible "Agent Actions" panel in kiosk sidebar that displays real-time OpenHands agent events (file reads, command runs, browser actions, etc.). Toggle state persists to localStorage.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Server-side** (`server/src/openhands.ts`, `server/src/index.ts`):
   - Added `AgentAction` interface and `AgentActionMessage` type
   - Added `formatEventSummary()` helper for human-readable action descriptions
   - Added `ActionCallback` and `setActionCallback()` in AISessionManager
   - Modified `connectWebSocket()` to forward agent action events to clients

2. **Client-side types** (`client/src/types.ts`):
   - Added `AgentAction` and `AgentActionMessage` types

3. **New hook** (`client/src/hooks/useAgentActions.ts`):
   - Manages actions list (max 50 retained)
   - Persists toggle state to localStorage
   - Provides `getActionIcon()` for action type icons

4. **UI** (`client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx`):
   - Added collapsible agent actions panel below participants
   - Shows action count badge when collapsed
   - Auto-scrolls to latest actions when expanded

5. **Styles** (`client/src/App.css`):
   - Added `.kiosk-agent-actions` panel styles
   - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Toggle button appears in kiosk sidebar below participants
- ✅ Toggle state persists in localStorage
- ✅ When enabled, agent actions display in collapsible panel
- ✅ Actions show: action type icon + brief description
- ✅ Panel auto-scrolls to show latest actions
- ✅ Maximum 50 actions retained (older ones pruned)
- ✅ Panel respects mobile/desktop responsive layout
- ✅ Performance: No UI jank with rapid event stream

**Tests:**
- ✅ 8 new unit tests for useAgentActions hook
- ✅ All server tests passing (37 tests)
- ✅ All client tests passing (55 tests)
- ✅ E2E tests passing

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ CI: All checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title)
