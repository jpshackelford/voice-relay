# Voice Relay Workflow Log

This file tracks orchestrator activity and human instructions for the voice-relay project.

## Workflow

The orchestrator works through **GitHub Issues** filed against this repository, one at a time:

1. Pick the next open issue (lowest number first)
2. Implement, test, create PR
3. Address reviews until merged
4. Move to next issue
5. Repeat until all issues are complete

## How to Use

**Human instructions:** Add an entry like this and the orchestrator will follow it:
```markdown
## INSTRUCTION: Your instruction here
```

The orchestrator will acknowledge with `[ACKNOWLEDGED]` once processed.

### 2026-05-18T17:13:00Z - Expansion Worker

✅ **Expanded Issue #213**

- Issue: [#213 - Smoke test failure after deployment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/213)
- Type: CI Failure
- Status: Ready for implementation (marked as likely duplicate of #209)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- AI remained stuck in "connecting" state for 60 seconds during smoke test
- The failing commit (`1732696`) contained only WORKLOG.md changes - no functional code
- Likely caused by #209 (Express trust proxy misconfiguration) not yet being fixed
- Express rate limiter throws `ValidationError` on `X-Forwarded-For` headers from Apache proxy

**Recommendation:**
- Low priority - issue will likely resolve automatically once #209 is merged
- Added `ready` and `priority:low` labels

---

### 2026-05-18 17:06 UTC - Expansion Worker

✅ **Expanded Issue #211**

- Issue: [Combined view oscilloscope shows flat line while standalone scope view works](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/211)
- Type: Bug
- Status: Ready for implementation
- Root cause: `useAudioAnalyser` hook's `useMemo` returns stale ref values because `setIsActive(true)` is called before async AudioContext setup completes. The refs are populated after the state change, but `useMemo` doesn't recalculate.
- Proposed fix: Move `setIsActive(true)` to after refs are populated (line ~126 in `useAudioAnalyser.ts`)
- Labels: `ready`, `bug`, `priority:high`

### 2026-05-18 15:44 UTC - Implementation Worker (`d55d893`)

✅ **PR #205 Created for Issue #204**

- **PR:** [#205 - feat(client): add unified input mode for voice + visualizer](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/205)
- **Issue:** [#204 - Mobile: Unify voice and visualizer modes with client-side STT](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/204)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for review

**Implementation Summary:**
Added new "Unified" input mode that combines Web Speech API transcription with oscilloscope visualization. Modern browsers handle two logical mic streams to the same physical microphone, so the Web Speech API and getUserMedia can coexist.

**Changes:**
1. Added `'unified'` to `InputMode` type: `'voice' | 'visualizer' | 'unified'`
2. Updated `MobileSettings` with three-button selector (Voice / Unified / Visualizer)
3. Updated `MobileMode` to handle unified mode:
   - Starts both Web Speech API and getUserMedia for oscilloscope
   - Shows oscilloscope in unified mode
   - Transcription auto-submits as in voice mode
4. Header toggle cycles: voice → unified → visualizer → voice
5. Added comprehensive tests for unified mode functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ New "Unified" input mode option in mobile settings
- ✅ Unified mode shows oscilloscope AND performs live transcription  
- ✅ Transcription auto-submits as it does in voice mode today
- ✅ Both streams clean up properly when stopped
- ⏳ Works on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (needs manual verification)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client tests: 407 passed
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ Build: Passes
- ✅ CI: All checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, Conventional Commits)

### 2026-05-18 15:55 UTC - Review Worker (`09881b0`)

✅ **PR #205 Review Feedback Addressed**

- **PR:** [#205 - feat(client): add unified input mode for voice + visualizer](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/205)
- **Issue:** [#204](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/204)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, All review threads resolved ✅, Ready for merge

**Review Feedback Addressed (3 threads → all resolved):**

1. **Extract stream cleanup logic** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - Extracted `cleanupAudioStream()` helper to reduce duplication
   - Now used consistently in mode change effect and handleMicToggle

2. **Extract getUserMedia + analyser start pattern** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - Extracted `startAudioVisualizer()` async helper
   - Centralizes the getUserMedia + analyser.start pattern for reuse

3. **Error handling could be more precise** (🟠 Important)
   - Unified mode now uses separate try-catch blocks
   - If speech recognition fails, returns early without starting visualizer
   - If visualizer fails after speech started, properly cleans up speech
   - Makes error handling explicit about what succeeded/failed

**Commit:** `c3fa7e1` - refactor(MobileMode): extract helpers and improve error handling

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client tests: 407 passed
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors

**PR is ready for merge.**

### 2026-05-18 15:50 UTC - Implementation Worker (`d14a3c8`)

✅ **PR #206 Created for Issue #167**

- **PR:** [#206 - feat(client): add toggle to show/hide agent actions from OpenHands event stream](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/206)
- **Issue:** [#167 - Add toggle to show/hide agent actions from OpenHands event stream](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/167)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for review ✅

**Implementation Summary:**
Added collapsible "Agent Actions" panel in kiosk sidebar that displays real-time OpenHands agent events (file reads, command runs, browser actions, etc.). Toggle state persists to localStorage.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Server-side** (`server/src/openhands.ts`, `server/src/index.ts`):
   - Added `AgentAction` interface and `AgentActionMessage` type
   - Added `formatEventSummary()` helper for human-readable action descriptions
   - Added `ActionCallback` and `setActionCallback()` in AISessionManager
   - Modified `connectWebSocket()` to forward agent action events to clients

2. **Client-side types** (`client/src/types.ts`):
   - Added `AgentAction` and `AgentActionMessage` types

3. **New hook** (`client/src/hooks/useAgentActions.ts`):
   - Manages actions list (max 50 retained)
   - Persists toggle state to localStorage
   - Provides `getActionIcon()` for action type icons

4. **UI** (`client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx`):
   - Added collapsible agent actions panel below participants
   - Shows action count badge when collapsed
   - Auto-scrolls to latest actions when expanded

5. **Styles** (`client/src/App.css`):
   - Added `.kiosk-agent-actions` panel styles
   - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Toggle button appears in kiosk sidebar below participants
- ✅ Toggle state persists in localStorage
- ✅ When enabled, agent actions display in collapsible panel
- ✅ Actions show: action type icon + brief description
- ✅ Panel auto-scrolls to show latest actions
- ✅ Maximum 50 actions retained (older ones pruned)
- ✅ Panel respects mobile/desktop responsive layout
- ✅ Performance: No UI jank with rapid event stream

**Tests:**
- ✅ 8 new unit tests for useAgentActions hook
- ✅ All server tests passing (37 tests)
- ✅ All client tests passing (55 tests)
- ✅ E2E tests passing

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ CI: All checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title)

### 2026-05-18 16:49 UTC - Expansion Worker

✅ **Issue #209 Expanded and Ready**

- **Issue:** [#209](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/209) - Fix Express trust proxy configuration causing proxy errors
- **Labels Added:** `ready`, `priority:high`

**Root Cause Verified:**
- Express app created at `server/src/index.ts:95` without `trust proxy` setting
- `express-rate-limit` v8.5.0 throws ValidationError when X-Forwarded-For header is present but trust proxy is false
- The `qrTokenLimiter` in sessions/router.ts triggers the error (lacks the `xForwardedForHeader: false` workaround)

**Implementation Details Added:**
- File to modify: `server/src/index.ts`
- Add `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` after `const app = express();` (line 95)
- This is the standard Express configuration for apps behind reverse proxies

**Status:** Ready for implementation worker to pick up.

### 2026-05-18 16:51 UTC - Implementation Worker (`80b043a`)

✅ **PR #212 Created - Add npm cache cleanup to rollback script**

- **PR:** [#212 - Add npm cache cleanup to rollback script](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/212)
- **Issue:** [#207](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/207) (Fixes #207)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, Ready for review

**Changes:**
- Modified `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (lines 342-346)
- Added `npm cache clean --force` before `rm -rf node_modules` in rollback step
- Updated comment to explain why both cache and node_modules need cleaning

**Why this matters:**
During the incident tracked in #197, the automatic rollback failed because it inherited the same corrupted npm cache that caused the original deployment failure. This created a cascading failure where both the initial deployment AND the recovery mechanism failed simultaneously. This fix ensures rollbacks start with a clean slate.

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Rollback script clears npm cache before reinstalling dependencies
- ✅ Comment explains why both cache and node_modules need cleaning
- ✅ YAML syntax validated (Python yaml parser + CI workflow runs)

**PR is ready for review.**

✅ **PR #206 Review Feedback Addressed**

- **PR:** [#206 - feat(client): add toggle to show/hide agent actions from OpenHands event stream](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/206)
- **Issue:** [#167](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/167)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, All review threads resolved ✅, Ready for merge

**Review Feedback Addressed (1 thread → resolved):**

1. **Remove unnecessary `actionCount` property** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - The code reviewer noted that `useMemo` was unnecessary for computing `actionCount` since `Array.length` is already O(1)
   - Removed the `actionCount` property entirely from the hook return object
   - Consumers already access `actions.length` directly where needed
   - Updated tests to remove `actionCount` assertions

**Commit:** `27940c6` - refactor(useAgentActions): remove unnecessary actionCount property

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client tests: 423 passed (10 tests in useAgentActions.test.ts)
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ CI: All 4 checks green (Build Client, Server Tests, E2E Tests, Conventional Commits)

**PR is ready for merge.**

### 2026-05-18 17:10 UTC - Review Worker

✅ **PR #212 Review Feedback Addressed**

- **PR:** [#212 - ci: add npm cache cleanup to rollback script](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/212)
- **Issue:** [#207](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/207)
- **Status:** CI passing ✅, All review threads resolved ✅, Ready for merge

**Review Feedback Addressed:**

1. **Asymmetric protection** (🟠 Important)
   - Added npm cache cleanup to main deployment step (not just rollback)
   - Both deploy and rollback now use same `npm cache verify || npm cache clean --force` pattern
   - Both now also `rm -rf node_modules` for consistent clean-slate approach
   - Commit: `e90835f`

2. **Use npm cache verify instead of --force** (🟡 Suggestion)
   - Changed from `npm cache clean --force` to `npm cache verify || npm cache clean --force`
   - Tries lighter-weight cache verification first, falls back to nuclear option if verify fails
   - Applied to both deploy and rollback for consistency
   - Commit: `e90835f`

**Verification:**
- ✅ CI: All checks passing (4/4)
- ✅ All review threads resolved (2/2)
- ✅ YAML validated

**PR is ready for merge.**
