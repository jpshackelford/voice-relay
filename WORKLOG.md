### 2026-06-04 18:27 UTC - Expansion Worker (#389)

✅ **Expanded Issue #389** — Teach default system prompt to call `PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings`

- Type: Enhancement (prompt-engineering follow-up to merged PR #385)
- Status: **Ready for implementation** (`ready` label applied)
- Approach: Insert a new "Session Settings API" section into `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` immediately after the existing "Display API" block. Documents `PATCH /api/sessions/{{SESSION_ID}}/settings` with `Authorization: Bearer $DISPLAY_API_SECRET` and the four mutable fields (`tts`, `inputMode`, `autoSubmit`, `agentPrompt`), with 5 concrete `curl` examples and a "When NOT to call" carve-out for device-volume / one-off / stylistic asks.
- Files affected: `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` (+~45 lines), `server/src/openhands.test.ts` (+~30 lines, plus updating `sessionIdMatches.length` from 4 → 9). No server code, no router, no schema, no migration.
- Risks flagged in technical comment: prompt bloat, ambiguous triggers ("turn it down"), agent self-reprogramming via `agentPrompt`, and the well-known flakiness of LLM-driven e2e tests. Recommended a server-side contract test for CI + a manual live-LLM smoke for the PR description, instead of trying to gate on real-LLM behaviour.

### 2026-06-04 19:18 UTC - Implementation Worker (#383)

🚧 **Opened PR [#391](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/391)** — Speaker identity model (server-only, scope: server, priority: medium)

- **Status:** Draft → Ready. All CI green (Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests 2m14s, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator).
- **Migration:** 017 `speakers` — additive only. Creates `auth_identities` + `speakers`; adds `devices.primary_user_id`, `session_devices.active_speaker_id`, `messages.speaker_id`. Backfills existing GitHub users into `auth_identities`. Down migration restores v16 schema and round-trips cleanly.
- **REST surface added:** `GET/POST /api/workspaces/:wsId/speakers` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/workspaces/:wsId/speakers/:speakerId` — owner-only writes, member reads. Input validated (length caps, trim, blanks→null). 409 on duplicate speaker-per-user.
- **Agent wiring:** `[speaker name=… pronouns=… notes=…]` header emitted into the next prompt frame on inbound utterances; falls back to `[speaker id=unknown]` when the resolved speaker has no `preferred_name`, prompting the agent to ask and `PUT` it back. Updated `prompts/system-prompt.md` with a "Speaker identity" section.
- **Back-compat:** `users` table left intact (additive only). `UserRepository.create` dual-writes into `auth_identities` so existing GitHub OAuth flow keeps working unchanged.
- **Test delta:** +59 server tests (10 migration, 20 SpeakerRepository, 17 router, 12 AuthIdentityRepository). Total **1447 server tests passing / 68 files**. Coverage on new code: speakers 92.5% stmts / 87.5% branch / 100% funcs; auth/identity-repository 100% / 91% / 100%; migration 017 100% across the board — all over the 80% gate.
- **Production impact:** auto-deploys to vr.chorecraft.net on merge. Migration is additive on SQLite, safe on existing `sqlite.db`.

### 2026-06-05 01:57 UTC - Orchestrator (manual `/orchestrate`)

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `4a78335` | review | [PR #391 — speaker identity model](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/391) (UUID-format bot suggestion) | **NEW** |
| `0171bb1` | implementation | [Issue #379 — CSS Grid kiosk overlays](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/379) (priority:low, scope:client-only) | **NEW** |
| `6cb2073` | expansion | [Issue #392 — Mobile workspace-home shortcut](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/392) | **NEW** |
| `be136d2` | expansion | [Issue #393 — Mobile multi-kiosk selector](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/393) | **NEW** |

**Spawned: 4 Workers (parallel)**

1. **Review Worker** — [PR #391 (speaker identity model)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/391)
   - CI is fully green (7/7) and PR is `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`, but there is 1 unresolved review thread from `github-actions[bot]`: a 🟡 _Suggestion_ about UUID format inconsistency in migration 017 (`lower(hex(randomblob(...)))` vs canonical UUID v4).
   - Conversation: [`4a78335`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/4a783354a9d24d9083ae7dcabf415de6)

2. **Implementation Worker** — [Issue #379 (CSS Grid kiosk overlays)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/379)
   - Highest unblocked work: priority:low + client-only + oldest of the ready+low set.
   - #382 (priority:medium) was skipped because it sits on top of PR #391's still-unmerged `speakers` schema — picking it up now would conflict.
   - Conversation: [`0171bb1`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/0171bb1c3e22434bba1c6c96e2576799)

3. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #392 (mobile workspace-home shortcut)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/392)
   - Conversation: [`6cb2073`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/6cb207359459433b869c28d1ef4a4cb7)

4. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #393 (mobile multi-kiosk selector)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/393)
   - Conversation: [`be136d2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/be136d224c8a4f0f9aea5173794090de)

**Pre-spawn state reconciliation:**
- Implementation worker `a0b08f1` (issue #383) was still listed as active in `.workflow-state.json` but its OpenHands `execution_status` is `null` (no longer running). It had already shipped its work: PR #391 was opened at 2026-06-04 19:18 UTC. Moved to `.completed` with outcome _"Opened PR #391 — speaker identity model; CI green, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 1 unresolved bot review thread."_

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: **#391** (review worker now addressing the lone bot thread)
- Ready+prioritized issues being acted on: **#379** (impl)
- Ready+prioritized, queued (still unblocked):
  - **#382** medium — ticker speaker identity (waits for PR #391 to merge)
  - **#389** low — system-prompt PATCH /api/sessions/:id/settings
  - **#380** low — kiosk indicator color
  - **#390** low — login footer layout
- Ready, unprioritized: **#386** (hosted STT), **#388** (per-device mic state) — need `/assess-priority`
- Expansion in flight: **#392, #393**
- On-hold: #210, #239, #299–#302, #351, #363, #384
- Needs-human: #372

**Slot usage after spawn: 2/4 expansion, 1/1 impl, 1/2 review (4/7 total).** Remaining capacity: 2 expansion + 1 review.

`quiet_ticks` reset `2 → 0` (productive tick — 4 workers spawned + state reconciliation).

### 2026-06-05 01:59 UTC - Expansion worker (issue #392)

✅ Expanded **#392** — _Mobile: workspace-home shortcut next to settings (owner-only)_.

Issue body was already rich (Motivation + Proposal + AC). Posted a [verification + technical-approach comment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/392#issuecomment-4627473036) rather than rewriting. Findings:

- Top-bar slot confirmed at `MobileMode.tsx:294–301` (the existing ⚙️ button).
- **Ownership wiring simpler than proposal**: `Workspace.isOwner: boolean` is already on the type (`useWorkspaces.ts:12`) and used directly by `SessionView.tsx:266`. No new hook needed; just pass `isOwner` as a prop.
- **Route correction**: `WorkspaceHome` lives at `/workspace/:workspaceId` (App.tsx:74–81), not `/workspaces/:slug` as the body stated. Link target should be `` `/workspace/${workspaceId}` ``.
- Two call sites need the prop pass-through: `pages/Workspace.tsx:311` and `pages/SessionView.tsx:542`.
- Scope is purely client; no API/CSS change. **~40 LOC across 4 files**, two new test cases.

Labels added: `ready, enhancement, client, scope:client-only, priority:low`.

### 2026-06-05 02:01 UTC - Review worker (PR #391)

✅ Addressed the one unresolved review thread on PR #391
(`feat/383-speaker-identity-model`) flagged by `github-actions[bot]`.

| Thread | Decision | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| Migration 017 UUID format inconsistency | ✅ Accepted — backfill now emits canonical UUID v4 shape (`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`) so backfilled and `randomUUID()`-generated `auth_identities.id` values match. | [`9839844`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/commit/9839844) |

Migration 017 tests (`017_speakers.test.ts`, 10 tests) still pass locally.
All CI checks green on the PR (`Server Tests`, `Client Tests`, `E2E Tests`,
`Build Client`, `lint-pr-title`). Thread replied to + resolved via GraphQL.
PR moved back from draft → ready for review.

### 2026-06-05 02:03 UTC - Expand worker (#393 mobile kiosk picker)

✅ Expanded issue #393 — *Mobile: pick which kiosk drives a new session when the workspace has multiple kiosks*.

| Action | Detail |
|---|---|
| Comment | Posted technical verification + approach ([#393 comment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/393#issuecomment-4627487041)). Issue body was already comprehensive (Motivation/UX/Implementation outline/AC/Non-goals), so verified the proposal against current code rather than rewriting. |
| Code walked | `server/src/sessions/*`, `server/src/registry.ts` (`broadcastDeviceList`), `server/src/index.ts` (WS register + `resolveSessionForDevice` + `/api/display`), `client/src/components/MobileMode.tsx`, `MobileSettings.tsx`, `KioskMode.tsx`. |
| Key call-outs in comment | (1) **Session resolution model is the load-bearing change** — picker semantics require *one active session per kiosk* (Idle/In-session/Join branches all depend on it). (2) **A SQLite migration IS required** (`sessions.target_kiosk_device_id`) — contradicts the prompt's "probably none" hint. (3) `device-list` WS broadcast + `session.metadata.displayContent` can be reused for status pills and preview thumbnail — no new caching layer. (4) New WS message `kiosk-attention` for the on-screen "📱 connecting…" banner. |
| Labels applied | `enhancement`, `scope:full-stack`, `priority:medium`, `ready`. |

### 2026-06-05 02:08 UTC - Impl worker (#379 kiosk grid)

✅ Implemented #379 — *Adopt a CSS Grid layout for the kiosk display overlays
(status circles, tickers, QR, connection dot)*. Draft PR
[#394](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/394) opened, all CI
checks green, then moved from draft → ready for review.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Branch | `feat/379-kiosk-overlay-css-grid` |
| Files touched | `client/src/App.css` (only; +107 / -59) |
| Approach | Converted `.kiosk-display` from `display: flex` + six `position: absolute` overlays to a 4-column / 3-row named-area grid (`tl . . tr` / `main main main main` / `bl tick-l tick-r br`). Outer 4rem gutter columns replace the legacy `padding-{left,right}: 4rem` reservations on the ticker strips; fixed 3.5rem bottom row puts circles and ticker text on a shared horizontal baseline. |
| `data-tickers-enabled` toggle | Retained, but now switches the connection dot's `grid-area` (`bl` ↔ `tr`) instead of overriding `top/right/bottom/left`. |
| Mobile (≤480px) | `@media` block re-expressed as a `grid-template-areas` redefinition — tickers each get their own full-width row; `bl` / `br` span both rows so the corner circles continue to overlay at the bottom corners. |
| Tests | `cd client && npm test -- KioskMode` → **88/88 pass** unchanged. `cd client && npm run build` (runs `tsc -b`) → clean. No Playwright visual baselines in repo to regenerate. |
| CI | `Build Client`, `Client Tests`, `Server Tests`, `E2E Tests` (1m33s), `lint-pr-title`, `enable-orchestrator` all pass; `pr-review` is `skipping` until ready-state. |
| Acceptance criteria | All six AC items checked: `display: grid` with documented `grid-template-areas`, all overlays placed via `grid-area` (no remaining `position: absolute` corner offsets in their selectors), `padding: 4rem` reservations removed, `@media (max-width: 480px)` redefines `grid-template-areas`, class names + `data-testid` preserved, fixed 3.5rem bottom row with vertically-centered circles + flex-centered ticker text (per the follow-up comment's recommendation). |

### 2026-06-05 02:35 UTC - Implementation Worker (issue #382)

✅ **Issue #382 implemented** — [PR #395](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/395)

Transcription ticker now identifies the sending device/speaker on the kiosk: each new speaker's utterance is prefixed with their `senderName` (e.g. `JP's iPhone SE: I'll grab a coffee`), and same-sender follow-ups suppress the prefix so the marquee doesn't restart with a redundant `<name>: ` on every partial-update frame.

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `client/src/components/MarqueeTicker.tsx` | New optional `prefix?: string` prop, rendered as a sibling `<span class="kiosk-ticker-speaker">` before the text inside the existing measured inner span; layout effect re-runs on prefix change. |
| `client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx` | Replaced `transcriptionTickerText: string` with a `transcriptionTicker: { prefix, text }` memo. Same-sender suppression via `lastRenderedSenderIdRef`, updated in a commit-time `useEffect`. `fauxPulse` keys off `transcriptionTicker.text` so a same-sender partial still pulses and a prefix appearing/disappearing alone does not. |
| `client/src/App.css` | Added `.kiosk-ticker-speaker { font-weight: 600; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); margin-right: 0.4em }`. No layout changes; `@media (max-width: 480px)` stacked layout untouched. |
| `client/src/components/{KioskMode,MarqueeTicker}.test.tsx` | +10 unit tests covering: prefix appears for new sender, suppressed on same-sender follow-up, re-emits on sender switch, empty strip has no orphan `:`, and that the overflow translation still works with prefix+text. |

- **Scope verdict:** client-only as labeled. `Utterance.senderName` has been on the wire since #346; no server, DB, or WebSocket change. PR #391 (issue #383's `speakers` table) is still draft, so this PR ships against `Utterance.senderName` — a follow-up after #391 lands can swap the source to `speakers.preferred_name` and re-key suppression on `speaker_id`, per the revised acceptance comment on #382.
- **Tests:** `npm run test -w client` → **1029/1029 ✅** (49 files; MarqueeTicker 7 → 13 tests, KioskMode 88 → 92 tests). `npm run build -w client` → ✅ (tsc + Vite). All required CI checks green on PR #395: Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, E2E Tests (1m40s), lint-pr-title.
- **Workflow:** branch `feat/382-ticker-speaker-prefix` from main → implement → tests → commit (`feat(client): identify the sending device/speaker in the transcription ticker`) → push → DRAFT PR opened with `Fixes #382` → CI watched to green → PR moved to ready-for-review.
- **Outstanding:** none from the issue's acceptance criteria; follow-up (post-#391) noted in the PR body for swapping the identity source to the workspace-scoped `speakers` table.

### 2026-06-05 02:40 UTC - Merge worker (PR #394)

✅ **PR #394 merged** — [feat(client): adopt CSS Grid for kiosk display overlays (#379)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/394)

CSS-only refactor of `.kiosk-display` from `flex` + six `position: absolute` overlays to a named-area CSS Grid. Outer 4rem gutter columns are now the single source of truth for circle placement; legacy `padding-{left,right}: 4rem` reservations on the ticker strips retired. Fixed 3.5rem bottom row places corner circles and both ticker strips on a shared horizontal baseline.

| Check | Status |
|------:|--------|
| CI (7 checks: Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator, pr-review) | ✅ all SUCCESS |
| Mergeable / mergeStateStatus | `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN` |
| Labels | none (no `on-hold` / `needs-human` / `do-not-merge`) |
| Unresolved review threads | 0 (2 threads, both resolved) |
| Latest review rating | 🟢 Good taste (LOW risk) |
| Migration check | N/A — CSS-only diff (`client/src/App.css`) |
| Issue #379 | auto-closed via `Closes #379` |

- First merge attempt got `GraphQL: Base branch was modified. Review and try the merge again.` (main advanced between guard-check and merge). Re-checked mergeability → `CLEAN`, retried, succeeded.
- Production note: app auto-deploys to vr.chorecraft.net on merge to main; this is a pure CSS change so DB / SQLite is unaffected.

### 2026-06-05 02:40 UTC - Merge worker (PR #391 → main)

✅ **PR #391 merged** — `feat(server): speaker identity model (#383)` — closes #383.

Squash commit: `3ca5fdc37cdca58104518794cb5bd7d2c6d51a1b`

**Merge-readiness verification (immediately pre-merge):**

| Guard | State |
|------|-------|
| CI checks | 7/7 SUCCESS (Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator, pr-review) |
| Unresolved review threads | 0 (2 total threads, both resolved) |
| `mergeable` / `mergeStateStatus` | `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN` |
| Blocking labels | none (`on-hold`, `needs-human`, `do-not-merge` all absent) |
| Draft | no |
| Latest bot review | 🟡 Acceptable — solid implementation, only minor improvement opportunities (no blockers) |

**Production migration check (017_speakers):**

- Up path is **purely additive**: 2 × `CREATE TABLE` (`auth_identities`, `speakers`), 3 × `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` (`devices.primary_user_id`, `session_devices.active_speaker_id`, `messages.speaker_id`), plus indexes and a backfill `INSERT` from `users.github_id`. No existing rows touched, no FK breakage — safe to run inside the migrator transaction with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`.
- Down path rebuilds `messages`, `session_devices`, and `devices` to drop the new columns (SQLite < 3.35 has no `DROP COLUMN`) and round-trips cleanly per the new `017_speakers.test.ts`.
- `users.github_id` / `users.username` are retained as a compatibility shadow — existing GitHub OAuth keeps working unchanged; a future migration can drop them once every read path uses `auth_identities`.
- No manual post-deploy steps required: `vr.chorecraft.net` auto-applies migrations on boot via `SQLiteStore.connect()`. The orchestrator should monitor the next deploy for migration 017 applying cleanly.

**What landed:**

- `auth_identities` (provider-agnostic identity bookkeeping, backfilled from GitHub).
- `speakers` (workspace-scoped persistent speaker profiles; partial unique index on `(workspace_id, user_id)` allows multiple anonymous speakers).
- `devices.primary_user_id` (records the QR-mode authenticator).
- `session_devices.active_speaker_id` + `messages.speaker_id` (per-utterance speaker attribution).
- REST: `GET/POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/speakers` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/speakers/:speakerId` (owner-only writes, member reads, 409 on duplicate, 404/403/401 elsewhere).
- `AuthIdentityRepository` + dual-write on user create.
- `SpeakerRepository` + `createSpeakerRouter` mounted in `server/src/index.ts`.
- `prompts/system-prompt.md` gains a "Speaker identity" section; `agent-driver/voice-relay-header` carries speaker context to OpenHands.

**Tests:** 1447 server tests passing (49 new across migration round-trip, repo, router, identity repo). New-code coverage well above the 80% gate (router/repo 92.5% / 87.5% / 100% / 92.24%; identity repo 100%; migration 100%).

**Follow-up unlocked:** PR #395 (issue #382 transcription ticker speaker prefix) explicitly noted that once #391 lands, the ticker's identity source can swap from `Utterance.senderName` to `speakers.preferred_name` keyed on `speaker_id`. That follow-up is now actionable.

### 2026-06-05 02:42 UTC - Review Worker (PR #391 round 1)

✅ **PR #391 review feedback addressed** — [PR #391](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/391)

| Thread | File:Line | Action | Commit |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Bot suggestion: redundant `devices.findById()` per utterance | `server/src/index.ts:207` (`resolveSpeakerForDevice`) | Accepted; cached `primary_user_id` on the in-memory `Device` and refactored the resolver to take it directly | `e5fd361` |

- **Refactor:** added `primaryUserId?: string \| null` to the registry-side `Device`, seeded by `DeviceRegistry.register(...)` from `deviceRepository.registerOrUpdate().device.primaryUserId` at WS register, refreshed via `DeviceRegistry.updateDevice` whenever the device router's `PATCH /:deviceId` claims it for a workspace user. `resolveSpeakerForUser(workspaceId, primaryUserId)` now only touches the `speakers` table — the relay path no longer queries `devices` per inbound utterance.
- **Tests:** +3 specs (registry cache from `register`, `updateDevice` refresh + clear, reconnect refresh, PATCH → registry sync). Suite 1447 → 1450, all green.
- **Workflow:** PR converted to draft → refactor + tests → committed (`refactor(server): cache primaryUserId on in-memory device (#383)`) → pushed → CI all green (Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, E2E Tests 1m40s, lint-pr-title) → thread replied + resolved via GraphQL → PR marked ready.
- **Scope:** server-only; the migration & schema from PR #391's prior commits are untouched, so the SQLite production DB on vr.chorecraft.net still rolls forward cleanly on merge.
- **Outstanding:** none; awaiting next review round.

**🚀 Spawned 2 Workers (parallel)**

1. **Review Worker** — [`2f51f22`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2f51f227cbf240268bb6064025ceaf47)
   - Target: [PR #395](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/395) — `feat(client): identify the sending device/speaker in the transcription ticker` (Fixes #382)
   - Blockers to clear:
     - **Merge conflict with main** (`mergeable: CONFLICTING, mergeStateStatus: DIRTY`) — branch was opened before PRs #391 and #394 merged; #394's CSS-Grid rework of `.kiosk-display` is the likely overlap.
     - **1 unresolved review thread** from `github-actions[bot]` on `client/src/components/MarqueeTicker.tsx`: comment claims the empty-state check covers `prefix && text`, but the code only checks `text.length === 0`, leaving an orphan `name:` risk if a stale prefix is passed without text. Worker to either tighten the check to `prefix.length === 0 && text.length === 0` or correct the comment to match actual behavior.
   - CI is otherwise green (Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, lint-pr-title, pr-review, enable-orchestrator).

2. **Implementation Worker** — [`ebe965d`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ebe965d848854a2c876002b9010e2181)
   - Target: [Issue #393](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/393) — `Mobile: pick which kiosk drives a new session when the workspace has multiple kiosks` (enhancement, priority:medium, scope:full-stack)
   - Highest-priority ready issue after #382 went into review. Expansion comment (2026-06-05) emphasized: (a) one-active-session-per-kiosk is the load-bearing invariant for picker semantics, (b) a SQLite migration IS required (contradicts the issue's "probably none" hint) — additive `sessions.target_kiosk_device_id TEXT NULL`, next number after `017_speakers`, (c) reuse existing `device-list` WS broadcast + `session.metadata.displayContent`, (d) new WS `kiosk-attention` message drives the kiosk on-screen "📱 connecting…" banner.
   - Production-safety: client + server + additive nullable column; safe to roll forward on vr.chorecraft.net.

**Slot Utilization:**

| Slot | Used | Limit | Available |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| Expansion | 0 | 4 | 4 (intentionally idle — all 8 unexpanded issues are `on-hold` or `needs-human`) |
| Implementation | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Review | 1 | 2 | 1 |

**Backlog Snapshot:**

- Ready & unblocked: #380, #386, #388, #389, #390, #392 (priority:low / unprioritized; #393 just dispatched).
- Needs expansion (all held): #210, #239, #299–#302 (S3 freeze still active per AGENTS.md), #372 (`needs-human`), #384 (`on-hold`).

**Housekeeping:**

- WORKLOG.md truncated to a 6-hour productive window: 21 entries (2026-06-01 + 2026-06-04 spans) moved to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-06-01.md` and `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-06-04.md`. File is now ~340 lines, down from 840+.
- `.workflow-state.json` v2: moved 3 finished workers into `completed[]` audit trail (20 entries within 24h window), added the 2 new ones, reset `quiet_ticks = 0`.

### 2026-06-05 03:03 UTC - Review worker (PR #395 round 1 — merge conflict + bot suggestion)

✅ **PR #395 (feat/382-ticker-speaker-prefix) — back to ready, all 7 checks green.**

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Resolve merge conflict with `main` | `client/src/App.css` — kept `.kiosk-ticker-speaker` from PR alongside the expanded `#379` grid-area comment that landed via PR #394. No other files touched. |
| Address `github-actions[bot]` review thread on `MarqueeTicker.tsx` | Chose the bot's "fix the code" branch: added JSX guard `text.length > 0 && prefix` so a non-empty prefix paired with empty text never renders an orphan `"<name>: "`. Rewrote the adjacent comment to describe the new contract. Added regression test `suppresses an orphan prefix when text is empty (defensive guard)`. |
| Client build + tests | `npm run build` clean (no TS errors). `npm test` 1030/1030 passing (was 1029 — new test adds 1). |
| Push | Merge commit `277bc63`. PR diff vs main now 5 files / +349 / -8, no WORKLOG or workflow-state churn. |
| CI rollup | Build Client ✓ · Client Tests ✓ · Server Tests ✓ · E2E Tests ✓ · lint-pr-title ✓ · pr-review ✓ · enable-orchestrator ✓. `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`. |
| Review thread | Replied with commit reference + AI disclosure, then resolved via GraphQL (`PRRT_kwDOSTUWGM6HPwfH`). No new threads opened by `pr-review`. |
| PR state | Demoted to draft at start (per process), promoted back to ready after green CI. |

Ready for the next round (merge or human review) — no further action from this worker.

### 2026-06-05 03:08 UTC - Merge worker (PR #395)

✅ **Squash-merged PR #395** — `feat(client): identify the sending device/speaker in the transcription ticker` — closes #382.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `mergeable` / `mergeStateStatus` | `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN` |
| CI (Server, Client, Build, E2E, lint-pr-title, pr-review) | All ✅ SUCCESS |
| Review threads | 1 total, 0 unresolved |
| Latest bot review (03:02 UTC) | 🟢 Good taste |
| Migration check | Diff touches `client/src/**` only — no `server/src/db/migrations/` paths. Safe for prod (SQLite, auto-deploy). |
| Issue #382 auto-close | ✅ Closed at 03:07:55 UTC via PR body `Fixes #382`. |

**Squash-commit message used:**

```
feat(client): identify the sending device/speaker in the transcription ticker (#395)

Render the kiosk transcription ticker as `{prefix}: {text}` so a viewer can tell whether a line came from `JP's iPhone SE` or `Mac-7acf1d6`. The prefix is a sibling span styled via `.kiosk-ticker-speaker` (heavier weight, muted color) inside the existing translated inner span, so marquee math is unchanged.

Sender name is resolved from `Utterance.senderName` (already on the wire since #346); same-sender follow-ups suppress the prefix via `lastRenderedSenderIdRef`, set in a commit-time `useEffect` (never mutated inside the memo). The empty-state guard was tightened so an empty utterance no longer leaves an orphan `:` delimiter.

Follow-up: once #391 (merged, deploys with this build) is in production, the ticker's identity source can swap from `Utterance.senderName` to `speakers.preferred_name` keyed on `speaker_id`. Out of scope here.

Fixes #382.
```

**Follow-up unlocked:** with #391 (speaker identity model) already merged and deploying alongside this change, a future PR can swap the ticker's identity source from `Utterance.senderName` to `speakers.preferred_name` keyed on `speaker_id`, and re-key the same-sender suppression on `speaker_id` instead of `senderId`. Not in scope for this merge — left for a follow-up issue.

**Production impact:** auto-deploy to vr.chorecraft.net on merge. Client-only change; no DB / WebSocket / server logic touched. SQLite production DB unaffected.

### 2026-06-05 03:11 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ebe965d` | implementation | [Issue #393](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/393) — Mobile kiosk picker | running (~19 min, started 02:52Z) |

**Workers Completed (this tick):**

| Conv ID | Type | Target | Outcome |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| `2f51f22` | review | PR #395 | Resolved merge conflict with main + tightened MarqueeTicker empty-state guard with regression test; CI 7/7 green; PR mergeable=CLEAN; bot re-reviewed 🟢 Good taste at 03:02Z. (Detailed entry by the review worker at 03:03Z, commit `9e15172`.) |
| `13c7a55` | merge | PR #395 | Squash-merged as `8ee7f07` — `feat(client): identify the sending device/speaker in the transcription ticker (#395)`. Issue #382 auto-closed at 03:07:55Z. (Detailed entry by the merge worker at commit `0d4198a`.) Worker was spawned by this orchestrator at 03:06Z and completed at 03:08Z. |

**🚀 Spawn rationale (for `13c7a55`):**

At 03:06Z the review worker `2f51f22` had reached `finished` and PR #395 had every merge gate green:

- ✅ CI 7/7 (Build Client, Client Tests, Server Tests, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, pr-review, enable-orchestrator)
- ✅ `mergeable: MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`
- ✅ Review threads: 1 total, 0 unresolved
- ✅ Latest bot review: 🟢 **Good taste** (github-actions, 03:02:32Z)
- ✅ No blocking labels (`on-hold`, `needs-human`, `do-not-merge`, `blocked` all absent)
- ✅ Client-only (no `server/src/db/migrations/` files) — production-safe roll-forward on vr.chorecraft.net

The merge worker carried out the squash + auto-close cleanly in ~2 minutes.

**Slot Utilization (after this tick):**

| Slot | Used | Limit | Available |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| Expansion | 0 | 4 | 4 (intentionally idle — all unexpanded issues remain `on-hold` or `needs-human`) |
| Implementation | 1 | 1 | 0 (`ebe965d` on #393 still running) |
| Review/Merge | 0 | 2 | 2 (no open PRs — #395 just merged) |

**No new workers spawned this tick beyond `13c7a55`:**

- Implementation slot is occupied — only one impl at a time to avoid branch conflicts (skill rule).
- No open PRs remain → review/merge slots have nothing to do.
- All unexpanded issues are blocked behind `on-hold` (S3 freeze: #299–#302; #384) or `needs-human` (#372). Expansion slots correctly stay idle.

**Backlog Snapshot:**

- Ready & unblocked (awaiting impl): #380, #386, #388, #389, #390, #392 (priority:low / unprioritized). #393 in flight.
- Needs expansion (all held): #210, #239, #299–#302, #372, #384.

**State file:** `.workflow-state.json` v2 — `2f51f22` (review) and `13c7a55` (merge) moved to `completed[]`; 22 entries within the 24h audit window; `quiet_ticks = 0`.

### 2026-06-05 03:30 UTC - Implementation Worker (#393 → PR #396)

🚀 **Mobile kiosk picker for multi-kiosk workspaces — PR #396 opened (ready for review).**

- PR: <https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/396>
- Branch: `feat/393-mobile-kiosk-picker`
- All required checks green: Build Client, Client Tests (1039), Server Tests (1477), E2E Tests, lint-pr-title.

**What landed (per expansion comment, four load-bearing call-outs):**

1. ✅ **One active session per kiosk** invariant — new `SessionRepository.getOrCreateActiveSessionForKiosk(workspaceId, kioskDeviceId)` + `getActiveSessionForKiosk` query path.
2. ✅ **Migration `018_session_target_kiosk`** — additive nullable `sessions.target_kiosk_device_id TEXT` column, default NULL. Backward compat verified.
3. ✅ **Reuse `device-list` WS broadcast** — `DeviceRegistry.broadcastDeviceList` enriches each kiosk row with `activeSessionId` + `lastUsedAt` via `getKioskPickerEnrichment`. No new caching layer.
4. ✅ **New WS message `kiosk-attention`** with `ttlMs` for the `📱 connecting…` banner on the chosen kiosk. Wired through `useWebSocket` → `KioskMode`.

**Backward-compat tweak caught by E2E:** the first kiosk to register in a workspace now claims any existing **unbound** active session instead of opening a duplicate (fix commit `fa521c9`). Without this, single-kiosk workspaces created mobile-first ended up with two `View →` buttons on the dashboard — caught by `qr-join-flow.spec.ts` in CI, fixed before review.

**Coverage:** new server tests in `018_session_target_kiosk.test.ts`, `session-repository.test.ts` (`per-kiosk active sessions (#393)` describe + new backward-compat case), `registry.test.ts`, `resolve-session-for-device.test.ts`. New client tests in `KioskPicker.test.tsx`, `MobileMode.test.tsx` `#393` describe, `KioskMode.test.tsx` `kiosk-attention #393` describe, `useWebSocket.test.ts` register + dispatch.

### 2026-06-05 03:34 UTC - Orchestrator

🚀 **Spawned 2 workers (review + implementation, parallel)**

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `c327b70` | review | PR #396 — `kiosk-attention` target validation | **NEW** |
| `fee6d4e` | implementation | Issue #380 — kiosk oscilloscope blue accent | **NEW** |

**Current State:**
- [PR #396](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/396): `oR green ready 💬1` — one unresolved github-actions bot thread (defensive validation of `targetKioskDeviceId`).
- Implementation worker `ebe965d` (Issue #393 → PR #396) finished — moved to `completed[]`.
- No issues need expansion. All unexpanded items are on-hold/needs-human (S3 freeze + #372 + #384).

**Backlog Snapshot (ready, unblocked):**
- In-flight impl: #380 (now), #393 (PR #396 in review).
- Awaiting impl slot: #386, #388 (unprioritized); #389, #390, #392 (priority:low).

**Decision Rationale:**
- Review slot picked PR #396 — only open PR, has 1 unresolved bot thread, CI already green.
- Impl slot picked #380 — lowest-numbered prioritized, scope:client-only, simple CSS/token fix → quick win to keep throughput up while #393's review round closes.
- Skipped #386 / #388 (unprioritized) deliberately — they need `/assess-priority` triage before next tick (medium vs low matters once impl slot frees).

**State file:** `.workflow-state.json` v2 — `ebe965d` archived; `c327b70` + `fee6d4e` added to slots; `quiet_ticks` reset to 0.

### 2026-06-05 03:53 UTC - Orchestrator

🚀 **Respawned 2 workers — previous spawn attempts were stuck.**

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `eb2c297` | review | PR #396 — `kiosk-attention` target validation | **NEW** (running, ~$1.21) |
| `ebaceb3` | implementation | Issue #380 — kiosk oscilloscope blue accent | **NEW** (running, ~$1.08) |

**Bug discovered & worked around:**
The previous orchestrator (`c61a340` at 03:30Z) recorded `c327b70` and `fee6d4e` as worker conv_ids in `.workflow-state.json`. Those are actually **start-task IDs**, not `app_conversation_id`s. The real sub-conversations were `3dd8f41` (review) and `948a96a` (impl) — both spawned successfully but sat **idle for ~18 min at $0.00 cost** with `updated_at == created_at`. They never executed the initial message and would never have made progress.

Detection method (worth recording for future ticks): query `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` to map start-task id → `app_conversation_id`, then check that conv for `execution_status == running` and `metrics.accumulated_cost > 0`. If cost is 0 and `updated_at == created_at` more than ~5 min after spawn, the worker is dead — respawn.

**Action taken this tick:**
1. Verified PR #396 (CI 7/7 green, MERGEABLE) still has 1 unresolved `github-actions[bot]` thread on `server/src/index.ts` re: defensive `targetKioskDeviceId` validation — review work is still needed.
2. Verified Issue #380 (priority:low, scope:client-only CSS swap) is unimplemented.
3. Marked `c327b70` and `fee6d4e` as `status: stuck` in `completed[]` (with `actual_conv_id` cross-reference for debugging).
4. Spawned replacements via `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `run: true`; both confirmed `execution_status: running` and burning tokens after 25s.
5. Reset `quiet_ticks` to 0.

**Current State:**
- [PR #396](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/396): `green ready 💬1` — `eb2c297` now addressing.
- Ready, unblocked, awaiting impl slot: #386, #388 (both unprioritized — need `/assess-priority` next tick); #389, #390, #392 (priority:low).
- Issues needing expansion: all on `on-hold` or `needs-human` (S3 freeze #299–#302, #372, #384, plus #210/#239).

**Follow-up for skill maintainers:**
The `/spawn-conversation` skill in the voice-relay plugin should record `app_conversation_id` (from `start-task.app_conversation_id`), not the start-task ID, into `.workflow-state.json`. This tick's stuck workers are the second instance of this bug class (see also the missing-conv pattern that motivated the `actual_conv_id` field). A patch to `spawn-conversation.md` to make the ID extraction explicit would prevent future repeats.

**State file:** `.workflow-state.json` v2 — `c327b70` and `fee6d4e` archived as `stuck`; `eb2c297` + `ebaceb3` added to slots; 25 completed entries within audit window; `quiet_ticks = 0`.

### 2026-06-05 03:58 UTC - Implementation worker (issue #380 replacement)

✅ **Issue #380 — left kiosk oscilloscope is now blue, not purple.** Replacement for the stuck `948a96a…` sub-conversation flagged in the previous orchestrator entry (spawned but never executed; `cost == $0`, `updated_at == created_at`).

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Branch | `fix/380-kiosk-oscilloscope-blue` |
| PR | [#397](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/397) — opened draft, promoted to ready after CI |
| Files changed | `client/src/App.css`, `client/src/components/KioskMode.tsx`, `client/src/components/KioskMode.test.tsx` |
| Diff size | +34 / −5 across 3 files |
| Client tests | 1031/1031 pass (added one assertion: kiosk passes `color="#3282b8"` to `<Oscilloscope>`) |
| Client build | clean (`tsc -b && vite build`) |
| CI | Build Client ✅, Client Tests ✅, Server Tests ✅, E2E Tests ✅, lint-pr-title ✅, enable-orchestrator ✅; pr-review skipping while draft, will run on ready |
| Scope | `scope:client-only` — no DB, server, or schema impact |

Followed the expansion comment's diff exactly: `rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.2)` → `rgba(50, 130, 184, 0.2)`, `2px solid #a855f7` → `2px solid #3282b8` on `.kiosk-oscilloscope-indicator`, and `color="#a855f7"` → `color="#3282b8"` on the `<Oscilloscope>` inside `KioskMode.tsx`. Also refreshed the stale "same purple-circle treatment" comment above the CSS rule. Right-side `.kiosk-ai-status` untouched (still purple, as required).

For the test, mocked `./Oscilloscope` with a `<div data-testid="oscilloscope-mock" data-color={color}>` shim — canvas content is awkward to inspect in happy-dom, but the data-color prop round-trip is a clean, deterministic assertion. The existing `Oscilloscope.test.tsx` already covers the canvas-side mapping from `color` prop → `ctx.strokeStyle` / `ctx.shadowColor`.
