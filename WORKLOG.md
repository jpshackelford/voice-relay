**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `9e0d0dd` | merge | PR #430 (Fixes #351) | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: Merge Worker** for [PR #430](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/430) — *fix(server): broadcast degraded snapshot at register time after failed rehydration*
- Conversation: [`9e0d0dd`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/9e0d0dd588e746e3aab1c9ef3d4e1ca0)
- All CI green (Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, pr-review); mergeStateStatus=CLEAN; no review threads.
- Worker will run the Closing-Trailer AC gate against issue #351 before merging.

**State reconciliation:**
- Cleared finished workers from slots: `2bded59` (impl #384 → PR #428 merged) and `366d104` (merge PR #427 / #363). Both moved to `completed[]` audit trail.

**Unblock pass:** 2 issues flagged by mechanical detector (#299 via closed #298; #301 via closed #295), but both fall under the **AGENTS.md S3 design freeze** for issues #298–#302 — policy hold overrides mechanical signal. Freeze lifts only when production `VR_WORKSPACE_BUCKET` + AWS creds are provisioned. Not lifted this tick.

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: [#430](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/430) — merge worker dispatched ✅
- Ready issues: none (only #351 was ready, and it's now in PR #430)
- On-hold (policy): #210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #386 (S3 freeze + others)
- Needs-human: #372

**Slots after tick:** expansion 0/4, implementation 0/1, review 1/2.

### 2026-06-07 03:26 UTC - Merge worker (PR #430)

✅ **Merged** — `fix(server): broadcast degraded snapshot at register time after failed rehydration`

| | |
|---|---|
| PR | [#430](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/430) |
| Issue | [#351](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/351) — closed via `Fixes #351` trailer |
| Merge commit | `49b4d329c7fc51596795326b6fecb02b79a4ebd0` |
| Strategy | Squash |
| CI at merge | ✅ Server Tests, ✅ Client Tests, ✅ Build Client, ✅ E2E Tests, ✅ lint-pr-title, ✅ pr-review |
| Review threads | 0 / 0 (pr-review bot found nothing to flag) |
| Migrations | None — server-only behaviour fix, no schema changes |
| Production impact | Auto-deploys to vr.chorecraft.net. Risk: low — new branch is gated on driver `state === 'absent'` (previously a silent no-op) and only fires when `session_ai_state` carries `degraded`. Pre-#363 sessions are unaffected. |

**Closing-trailer AC gate — verdict: PASS**

Walked all 4 non-exempt AC items in #351 against the merged diff (`49b4d329…`):

| # | AC | Evidence in merged commit |
|---|----|---|
| 1 | First kiosk to register in session X receives `session-state` with `state: 'degraded'` (with rehydration error string) within one WS round-trip — no typing required | `server/src/resync-agent-status.ts` — on `state === 'absent'`, calls `synthesizeDegradedFromDurableState`, which reads `session_ai_state.findBySessionId` and returns a synthesized `degraded` AgentSessionStatus when the row is degraded. Both legacy `session-ai-status` and unified `session-state` are sent on the registering `ws` only. Verified by `resync-agent-status.test.ts` T-3.1.11 first test + integration test stage 1 (real SQLite + repo). |
| 2 | Subsequent successful attach clears persisted flag; normal `ready` snapshot broadcast | Already in production via `AISessionManager.persistInitialState` upserting `running` (no change needed in this PR). `register-time-degraded.integration.test.ts` second case asserts this exact contract: upsert `running` → next resync emits `ready` snapshot, no synthesized degraded. |
| 3 | Unit: failure path writes the durable degraded state; success path clears (idempotent on absent) | The original AC wording said "metadata field"; the implementation reasonably uses the `session_ai_state` table from #363 with the same semantics — explicitly addressed in the PR body. Failure-side durable write covered by existing `agent-rehydrate.test.ts` + integration test stage 1 assertion `aiStateRepository.findBySessionId(sessionId).state === 'degraded'`. Success-side clear via `persistInitialState` covered by stage-2 upsert behaviour. |
| 4 | Integration: kiosk registering after failed boot rehydration sees exactly one `degraded` broadcast on register — without the dropped-text handler firing | `register-time-degraded.integration.test.ts` exercises this end-to-end: real in-memory SQLite, real `SessionAIStateRepository`, real `rehydrateAgentSessions` failure, then `resyncAgentSessionStatus`. Asserts `expect(wsSends).toHaveLength(2)` (one logical broadcast — legacy + unified). Dropped-text handler is not in the code path. |

No `## INSTRUCTION:` override block was present for PR #430 + #351; gate passed cleanly on merits. Trailer `Fixes #351` retained → GitHub auto-closed #351 (verified: closed at 03:25:56 UTC).

Coverage on `resync-agent-status.ts`: **100% stmts / 100% funcs / 100% lines / 96% branches**. Full server suite: **1644/1644 passing**.

**Follow-up issues:** None filed. The PR body explicitly notes the original "expand-metadata-field at four call sites" plan from the issue was superseded by #363's `session_ai_state` table, which already covers the same lifecycle semantics. No remaining scope.

**Slot accounting after merge:** review slot freed (merge worker exits).

### 2026-06-07 10:35 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `3e55df8` | expansion | Issue #431 — speaker header on every session start | **NEW** |
| `6517d88` | expansion | Issue #432 — backfill devices.primary_user_id | **NEW** |
| `dd9d214` | expansion | Issue #433 — first-run "claim this device" prompt | **NEW** |
| `5df1586` | expansion | Issue #434 — connection status dot regression | **NEW** |

🚀 **Spawned: 4 Expansion Workers (parallel)**

1. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #431](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/431) (`feat(server)`, priority:medium, scope:full-stack)
   - Conversation: [`3e55df8`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/3e55df8fd8024d07accd6f01cf02e13a)
2. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #432](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/432) (`chore(server)`, priority:medium, scope:server-only)
   - Conversation: [`6517d88`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/6517d88d3c184c6b837ca1d49172d6f8)
3. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #433](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/433) (`feat(client)`, priority:medium, scope:client-only)
   - Conversation: [`dd9d214`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/dd9d214451704221b31e4cd316b8a770)
4. **Expansion Worker** — [Issue #434](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/434) (`bug(client)`, priority:medium, scope:client-only — regression of #394)
   - Conversation: [`5df1586`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5df1586b43b540f8ae4ffcdd117cea33)

**Gather state at tick start:**
- Open PRs: **none** (PR #430 merged at 03:25Z previous tick; no new PRs in the queue).
- Open issues: 12 total.
  - Needing expansion (no `ready`, no `on-hold`, no `needs-human`): **#431, #432, #433, #434** — all four dispatched this tick.
  - Ready (without policy/needs-human gate): **none** — #386 has `ready` but also `on-hold` (policy-tracked, no machine refs), so it remains held.
  - Policy / freeze on-hold: #210, #239, #299, #300, #301, #302, #386 (S3 freeze covers #298–#302 per AGENTS.md; #210, #239, #386 are policy-tracked too).
  - Needs human: #372.

**Unblock pass (mechanical):**

| Issue | Machine blockers | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #299 | #298 (CLOSED) | mechanically unblockable — but **S3 design freeze in AGENTS.md** explicitly covers #298–#302; policy hold dominates. Not lifted. |
| #300 | #298 (CLOSED), #299 (OPEN) | still mechanically blocked. |
| #301 | #295 (CLOSED) | mechanically unblockable — same S3 freeze override applies. Not lifted. |
| #302 | #300 (OPEN) | still mechanically blocked. |
| #386, #239, #210 | none (prose-only) | policy-tracked on-hold — only a human or new INSTRUCTION can lift. Untouched. |

Unblock pass: **0 issues lifted** (mechanical signals exist for #299 and #301 but the codified AGENTS.md S3 design-freeze policy overrides them — see "Active design freeze: workspace persistence (S3 / #298)" in AGENTS.md; the freeze lifts only when `VR_WORKSPACE_BUCKET` + AWS creds are provisioned on prod). Same behaviour as the 03:25Z tick.

**Anti-stall note:** the decision table is exhaustive. No `## INSTRUCTION:` override block exists in WORKLOG.md, and the four candidate issues (#431–#434) carry no codified gate. They are dispatchable on their merits — the expansion-slot cap of 4 happens to match the queue size exactly.

**Decision:** spawn expansion for all four (4/4 expansion slots used). Implementation slot stays idle because no `ready` issue is gate-free. Review slots stay idle because no open PRs exist.

**Slot accounting at end of tick:** expansion 4/4, implementation 0/1, review 0/2. Total active conversations: 4/7.

**Quiet-tick counter:** reset `1 → 0` (productive — 4 expansion workers dispatched, queue drained of expandable issues).

### 2026-06-07 10:38 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #434)

✅ **Expanded Issue #434**

- Issue: [bug(client): connection status dot rendering in left sidebar instead of kiosk display area](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/434)
- Type: Bug (CSS regression)
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied)
- Root cause: PR #394's grid refactor dropped the `.kiosk-display .connection-indicator` `position: absolute` override but left the base rule's `position: fixed` in place, so `grid-area: bl` is ignored and the dot stays at viewport `bottom: 1rem; left: 1rem;` — which is inside the open `.kiosk-sidebar`.
- Proposed fix: one-line CSS addition — `position: static;` on `.kiosk-display .connection-indicator` so the grid-area placement actually applies. No JSX changes. Test: extend the existing `KioskMode.test.tsx` "renders the connection indicator inside the kiosk display" case to also assert computed `position !== 'fixed'`, plus optional Playwright bounding-box containment check.
- Files: `client/src/App.css` (~line 3900), `client/src/components/KioskMode.test.tsx` (~line 2194), optionally `tests/e2e/kiosk.spec.ts`.
- Scope: `client-only`, priority:medium (carried from filing). Low risk — base `.connection-indicator` rule still applies for the workspace session view (correct) and the mobile kiosk path (correct).

### 2026-06-07 10:38 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #432)

✅ **Expanded Issue #432** — `chore(server): backfill devices.primary_user_id for devices paired before migration 017`

- Issue: [#432](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/432)
- Type: Enhancement (one-shot data backfill)
- Status: **Ready for implementation** (`ready` label applied)
- Approach: new migration `021_backfill_devices_primary_user.ts` that runs a single idempotent `UPDATE` setting `devices.primary_user_id = workspace_members.user_id WHERE role='owner'` for devices whose workspace has exactly one owner. Non-destructive; `down` is a no-op.
- Key findings during investigation:
  - `qr_tokens` does **not** record `created_by_user_id` (verified in `008_qr_tokens.ts` + `qr-token-repository.ts`), so the originally proposed "QR-token minter" heuristic was dropped from the plan.
  - `primary_user_id` is set today only by `PATCH /api/devices/:id` via `deviceRepository.setPrimaryUser` (`server/src/devices/router.ts:198`), not during initial QR pairing — corrected in the rewritten issue body.
  - Next available migration version is **021** (020 is the latest in `migrations/index.ts`).
- Test matrix (A: single owner, B: multi-owner, C: already-claimed, D: no-owner, E: idempotency re-run) documented in the rewritten body; mirrors the `017_speakers.test.ts` seeding pattern.
- Files affected (3): the new migration, its `.test.ts`, and `storage/migrations/index.ts`. No code-path changes outside migrations.

### 2026-06-07 10:42 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #431)

✅ **Expanded Issue #431**

- Issue: [feat(server): emit speaker header on every session start (resolved / no-name / unknown) and make agent opening message dynamic](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/431)
- Type: Enhancement (server-only, builds on #383 / #391 / #428)
- Status: Ready for implementation (`ready` label applied)
- Approach: Two-part fix — (A) extend `buildVoiceRelayHeader` in `server/src/agent-driver/voice-relay-header.ts` with a new branch that emits `[speaker id=unknown device=<deviceId>]` on the first turn from a device whose `primary_user_id` is `NULL` (today the unknown branch only fires when a previously-resolved speaker becomes unresolved, leaving pre-#383 / never-claimed devices with no `[speaker …]` line at all); (B) rewrite `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` so the "FIRST ACTION: Send a Greeting" instruction branches on the first user turn's speaker header (resolved + `name=` → greet by name; resolved no `name=` → ask name; `id=unknown` → ask name, using `device=` to disambiguate when multiple unknowns are talking) instead of firing the static `"Ready to help!"` payload before any user turn. Recommended over the richer alternative (B2 — inject `{{INITIAL_SPEAKERS}}` substitution into the system prompt at bind time via `applyPromptSubstitutions` + `autoConnectAI`) because B1 satisfies all four acceptance criteria with ~10 lines of TS + a prompt rewrite, no new resolver-interface plumbing, and no new substitution surface — B2 stays available as a follow-up.
- Files: `server/src/agent-driver/voice-relay-header.ts` (+ branch), `server/src/agent-driver/voice-relay-header.test.ts` (new cases: unknown-first-turn, multi-device unknown disambiguation, real-speaker resolution clears unknown state, no-repeat on consecutive turns), `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` (document the new form + rewrite FIRST ACTION), `server/src/resolve-session-system-prompt.test.ts` or a small new file (smoke-test the prompt contains the three branch markers and no longer the static `"Ready to help!"` payload).
- Scope: `scope:server-only` is sufficient (existing `scope:full-stack` can stay or be downgraded by the author). No DB migration, no API changes, no client changes.
- Risk: low. The only behaviour-changing surface is the built-in prompt's FIRST ACTION block; workspace/session prompt overrides (#378) are out of our control by design.

### 2026-06-07 10:48 UTC - Expansion Worker (issue #433)

🛑 **Expanded Issue #433** — `on-hold` (blocked by #431)

- Issue: [feat(client): first-run "claim this device" prompt for unknown speakers](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/433)
- Type: Enhancement (client-leaning, small server addition for the anonymous-name path)
- Status: `on-hold` — strict hard-block on #431 because the client first-run card needs a deterministic "device is unclaimed" WS signal, which is cheapest to emit from the same `registered`/speaker-resolution code path that #431 is already touching. A `Blocked by #431` line is in the on-hold comment so the orchestrator unblock pass will lift it automatically when #431 closes.
- Approach: extend `RegisteredMessage` with `speakerState { deviceClaimed, primaryUserId, activeSpeakerId }` (recommended bundled into #431); render a non-blocking `<FirstRunClaimCard>` in the existing `.kiosk-display` grid (#379/#394) and as a bottom sheet on mobile; three actions: (1) GitHub-auth → reuse `PATCH /api/workspaces/:id/devices/:id` which already triggers `setPrimaryUser` + `upsertForUser`; (2) anonymous name → **new** device-token-authenticated `POST /api/devices/:deviceId/sessions/:sessionId/active-speaker` writes an anonymous `speakers` row + `session_devices.active_speaker_id`; (3) skip → 7-day suppress in `localStorage` keyed by `workspaceId+deviceId`.
- Files: `client/src/types.ts` (extend `RegisteredMessage`), `client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (expose `speakerState`), new `client/src/hooks/useFirstRunClaim.ts` + tests, new `client/src/components/FirstRunClaimCard.tsx` + tests, `client/src/components/{KioskMode,MobileMode}.tsx` (render card), `client/src/pages/SessionView.tsx` (thread state), `client/src/App.css` (new `.first-run-claim-card` block + kiosk-grid area), `server/src/devices/router.ts` (new route), `server/src/session-devices-repository.ts` (new `setActiveSpeaker`), `server/src/index.ts` (overlap with #431: include `speakerState` on `registered`), router tests.
- Scope flag: issue is labeled `scope:client-only` but the anonymous-name path needs one new server endpoint. Noted in the technical comment — if #431 ships the `speakerState` surface, this stays mostly client-only; if not, the label should bump to `scope:full-stack`.
- Risk: low/medium. Existing schema already has all columns (migration 017). Watch-out: the new endpoint must clear `voiceRelayHeaderState.deviceSpeakerId` for the affected device or the very next utterance will still emit the cached stale speaker.

### 2026-06-07 10:54 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ae84ef1` | implementation | Issue #431 — speaker header on every session start | **NEW** |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#431 — feat(server): emit speaker header on every session start (resolved / no-name / unknown)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/431)
- Conversation: [`ae84ef1`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ae84ef1fe5fb4a8eb507c34f1737945d)
- Priority: medium (oldest of the three ready issues; landing it also unblocks #433)

**Worker Lifecycle Reconciliation:**
All four expansion workers from the 10:35Z tick are now `finished`. Moved to `completed[]` in `.workflow-state.json`:

| Conv ID | Issue | Outcome |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `3e55df8` | #431 | Ready — server-only fix; extend header builder unknown branch + system-prompt FIRST ACTION rewrite. |
| `6517d88` | #432 | Ready — migration 021 backfill (single-owner workspaces). |
| `dd9d214` | #433 | **on-hold** — `Blocked by #431` (deterministic speakerState WS signal). Will auto-lift when #431 closes. |
| `5df1586` | #434 | Ready — one-line CSS fix for kiosk connection dot (regression from #394). |

**Unblock Pass:** ran across 8 `on-hold` issues.

| Issue | Mechanical blockers | Decision |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| #433 | #431 (OPEN, ready) | still mechanically blocked. |
| #302 | #300 (OPEN) | still mechanically blocked. |
| #301 | #295 (CLOSED) ✓ | **NOT lifted** — AGENTS.md "Active design freeze: workspace persistence (S3 / #298)" overrides; freeze only lifts when `VR_WORKSPACE_BUCKET` + AWS creds are provisioned on prod. |
| #300 | #298 (CLOSED), #299 (OPEN) | one blocker still open AND under the S3 freeze. |
| #299 | #298 (CLOSED) ✓ | **NOT lifted** — same S3 design-freeze policy override. |
| #386, #239, #210 | none (prose-only) | policy-tracked on-hold — untouched. |

Unblock pass: **0 issues lifted** (mechanical signals exist for #299 and #301 but the codified AGENTS.md policy gate overrides — see "Anti-Stall: Decision Table is Exhaustive" §3, "documented policy in AGENTS.md"). Same verdict as the 10:35Z tick.

**Current State:**
- Open PRs: 0
- Ready issues (gate-free): #431 (now in impl slot), #432, #434 — all priority:medium
- On-hold: #433 (mechanical, lifts on #431 close), #386, #302, #301, #300, #299, #239, #210 (all policy-tracked)
- needs-human: #372

**Anti-stall note:** decision table is exhaustive. No `## INSTRUCTION:` override, no `on-hold`/`needs-human` label on #431/#432/#434, no AGENTS.md policy gating any of them. The impl-slot cap of 1 means #432 and #434 remain in the ready backlog for future ticks. Review slots (2 available) stay idle — no open PRs.

**Slot accounting at end of tick:** expansion 0/4, implementation 1/1, review 0/2. Total active conversations: 1/7.

**Quiet-tick counter:** stays at `0` (productive — 1 implementation worker dispatched; 4 expansion workers reconciled to `completed`).

### 2026-06-07 11:08 UTC - Implementation Worker (#431)

✅ Implemented and shipped PR for #431 — server emits speaker header on every session start (resolved / no-name / unknown) and agent opening message is dynamic.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Issue | [#431](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/431) |
| PR | [#435](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/435) (ready for review) |
| Branch | `feat/431-speaker-header-always` |
| CI | ✅ all required checks green (Server Tests 52s, Build Client 26s, Client Tests 40s, E2E 1m33s, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator) |
| Scope | server-only (per expansion comment — header builder + system prompt; no schema, no client) |
| Coverage | `voice-relay-header.ts` 96.96% stmts / 91.52% branches / 100% funcs |

**Diff (5 files, +293/-27):**

- `server/src/agent-driver/voice-relay-header.ts` — new branch emitting `[speaker id=unknown device=<deviceId>]` on first turn from a device with no resolved speaker history. Does not write `state.deviceSpeakerId` so a later real-speaker resolution still fires the `[speaker id=<realId> …]` line.
- `server/prompts/system-prompt.md` — "FIRST ACTION" rewritten from static `"Ready to help!"` to a three-branch dynamic greeting gated on the first user turn's `[speaker …]` header. Message format section documents the new `[speaker id=unknown device=<deviceId>]` form alongside the existing `[speaker id=unknown]` (post-unclaim) form.
- `server/src/agent-driver/voice-relay-header.test.ts` — new `unknown-on-first-turn (#431)` describe block (6 cases); 6 existing first-turn snapshots updated to include the new line; engine-fallback coexistence test pinned.
- `server/src/resolve-session-system-prompt.test.ts` — new `built-in prompt dynamic greeting (#431)` describe block (4 cases) guarding against regression to the static greeting.
- `server/src/openhands.test.ts` — #375 wire-text snapshot updated to include `[speaker id=unknown device=d-h]`.

**Acceptance-Criteria Gate (re-run against final diff, no CI fixes shifted coverage):**

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Exactly one `[speaker …]` line per joining device on first agent frame — never zero | ✅ | New unknown-on-first-turn branch + existing resolved branches |
| 2 | Header form matches three branches (resolved+name, resolved no name, `id=unknown device=`) | ✅ | All three covered in test block |
| 3 | Multi-device: one header per device with distinct `device=<deviceId>` | ✅ | Test "two unclaimed devices each emit their own `device=` line" |
| 4 | Default prompt branches opening message on header | ✅ | `system-prompt.md` rewrite of FIRST ACTION |
| 5 | Tests cover all three branches at frame-builder level + prompt smoke test | ✅ | 6 new header cases + 4 prompt cases |

**Verdict:** all non-exempt ACs satisfied — trailer is `Fixes #431`. No follow-ups required.

**Unblocks:** #433 (was on-hold pending this PR's merge).

| 4 | Default prompt branches opening on header | `system-prompt.md` "FIRST ACTION" rewrite with 3 explicit branches |
| 5 | Tests cover all three branches + prompt smoke | 6 new cases in `voice-relay-header.test.ts` (`unknown-on-first-turn (#431)`); 4 new cases in `resolve-session-system-prompt.test.ts` (`built-in prompt dynamic greeting (#431)`) |

Out-of-scope items from issue body (pre-017 backfill, kiosk first-run claim UX, anonymous speaker row creation on unauthenticated input) are explicitly deferred per the issue itself — exempt from gate.

**Migration check:** no-op. Diff touches no `db/migrations/*` files — server-only TypeScript change. Safe for production auto-deploy to vr.chorecraft.net.

**Production deploy:** triggered automatically on merge to main. No post-deploy steps required (no schema, no env changes, no data backfill).

**Follow-ups:**
- None filed — full AC coverage in this PR.
- #433 remains on-hold; the next orchestrator unblock pass will lift it (this merge worker explicitly does not).

### 2026-06-07 11:29 UTC - Implementation worker (issue #432)

🚧 → ✅ Opened PR #436 — `chore(server): backfill devices.primary_user_id for pre-017 devices`.

**Issue:** [#432](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/issues/432) — chore(server): backfill devices.primary_user_id for devices paired before migration 017.

**PR:** [#436](https://github.com/jpshackelford/voice-relay/pull/436) — ready for review. CI green (Server Tests, Client Tests, Build Client, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title, enable-orchestrator all pass; pr-review will run now that draft is lifted).

**Changes:**
- New migration `server/src/storage/migrations/021_backfill_devices_primary_user.ts` — one-shot data UPDATE setting `devices.primary_user_id` to the workspace owner's `user_id` when there is exactly one `workspace_members` row with `role='owner'`. `destructive: false`. `down` is `SELECT 1` with explanatory comment (no safe inverse).
- New test `021_backfill_devices_primary_user.test.ts` — covers AC matrix A–E plus a mixed-workload pass and the down no-op. 8 cases, all pass. New file is at 100% line/branch/function/statement coverage.
- `server/src/storage/migrations/index.ts` — import + append migration021.

**Local verification:**
- `npm test -- 021_backfill` → 8 passed.
- `npm test -- migrations` → 42 passed across the full chain.
- `npm test` (server) → 1656 passed.
- `npm run build` → clean tsc.

**Acceptance-criteria gate verdict:** ✅ **All 7 non-exempt AC items satisfied.** Trailer = `Fixes #432`. No follow-up issues filed.

| AC item | Status |
|---|---|
| Migration registered in `index.ts` | ✅ |
| Up sets `primary_user_id` for single-owner workspaces | ✅ (cases A + mixed) |
| Existing non-NULL never overwritten | ✅ (case C) |
| Re-run is a no-op proven by test | ✅ (case E asserts `changes === 0`) |
| Down is a no-op for the data side with comment | ✅ (down test + SQL comment) |
| `destructive: false` | ✅ (registry test) |
| Test file covers the matrix | ✅ |

**Coordination:** PR #435 (#431) untouched; disjoint code paths (header builder vs. migration), so no rebase needed at this point.

**Production deploy:** auto-runs on merge via the existing migrator boot path; no manual step. Idempotent on retry.
